<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/t.jpg" width="125" height="128" alt="T" /></span>HE discovery of an ocean route to
India, in 1497-98, marks an epoch
in the history of geographical
exploration no less than in that
of commerce. It confirmed the
hypothesis of a circumambient ocean, first put
forward by Hecataeus, but rejected by Ptolemy
and his numerous followers; and, at the same time
diverted into a new channel the profitable spice
trade with the East which for ages had passed
through Syria and Alexandria. In consequence
of this diversion Venice lost her monopoly, and
Lisbon became for a time the great spice-market
of Europe.</p>

<p>But Portugal was a small country whose resources
were hardly even equal to the task of waging the
continuous wars with the Moors in which she had
so unwisely been engaged for generations past.
And when, in addition to her African forces, she
was called upon to maintain great fleets in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
distant East, in order to enforce her monopoly of
the spice trade, at first in the face only of the
Moors, and afterwards in that of powerful European
rivals, her resources speedily came to an end, and
she found herself exhausted and helpless. It may
well be asked whether Portugal would not be
happier now, and richer, too, had she never had
the opportunity of dwelling upon these ancient
glories; had the wealth of the Indies never been
poured into her lap, only to breed corruption; and
had her strength not been wasted in a struggle to
which she was materially unequal, and which ended
in exhaustion and ruin.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/xii.jpg" width="300" height="296" alt="Vasco da Gama." />
<p class="center">Vasco da Gama.<br />(<i>From a Contemporary Medallion in the Cloister of Belem.</i>)</p></div>

<p>Portugal, however, notwithstanding the sad ending
of her vast Eastern enterprises, is still justly proud
of the achievements of her “great” Vasco da Gama,
and boldly places him by the side of Magelhães<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
and Christopher Columbus, as one of a noble triad
which occupies the foremost rank among the great
navigators of an Age of Great Discoveries.</p>

<p>Vasco da Gama was born, about 1460,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> at Sines,
of which coast-town his father, Estevão, was alcaidemór.
He was the youngest of three brothers.
Genealogists trace back his pedigree to a valiant
soldier, Alvaro Annes da Gama, who resided at
Olivença in 1280, and greatly distinguished himself
in the wars with the Moors. The Gamas could
thus boast of gentle blood, though they neither belonged
to the aristocracy of Portugal, nor were
they possessed of much worldly wealth.</p>

<p>We know next to nothing of Vasco da Gama’s
youth. When King João, after the return of
Bartholomeu Dias, decided to fit out an armada to
complete the discovery of an ocean highway to
India, he selected Vasco da Gama as its captain-major,
and this choice of the King was confirmed
by his successor, D. Manuel.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Such an appointment
would not have been made had not Vasco
da Gama already been known as a man of energy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>capacity and competent knowledge. We ought
therefore not be surprised if Garcia de Resende,
in his <i>Chronicle of D. João II</i> (c. 146), tells us
that he was a man whom the King trusted, as he
had already served in his fleets and in maritime
affairs, and whom he had consequently charged, in
1492, with the task of seizing the French vessels
lying in the ports of Algarve, in reprisal for the
capture by a French pirate of a Portuguese caravel
returning from S. Jorge da Mina with gold.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>Castanheda (I, c. 2) speaks of Vasco as having
done good service in the time of King João II, and
as being experienced in the affairs of the sea. Mariz
(<i>Dial.</i>, iv, c. 14; v, c. 1) calls him a young man
(<i>mancebo</i>), high-spirited and indefatigable, who had
such a thorough knowledge of navigation (<i>arte
maritima</i>) that he would have been able to hold
his own with the most experienced pilots of Europe.
We know, moreover, from Barros and Goes that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>he landed at S. Helena Bay with his pilots in
order to determine the latitude. These extracts
show, at all events, that Vasco da Gama was not a
mere landsman; nor is it likely that the command
of an expedition, the one object of which was
discovery, and not trade or war, would have been
entrusted to such an one.</p>

<p>He was, moreover, well qualified for his post in
other respects. His indomitable firmness made
him shrink from no obstacle which opposed itself
to the success of his expedition; and notwithstanding
the unheard-of length of the voyage and
the hardships endured, he retained the confidence
of his men to the very last.</p>

<p>The question whether Da Gama can fairly be
ranked with Columbus and Magelhães, has frequently
been discussed.</p>

<p>The first place among these three undoubtedly
belongs to Magelhães, the renegade Portuguese,
who first guided a ship across the wide expanse of
the Pacific. The second place is almost universally
accorded to Columbus, whose unconscious discovery
of a new world, fit to become the second home
of the European races, was immensely more far-reaching
in its consequences than the discovery of
an ocean highway to India, now largely discarded in
favour of the shorter route across the isthmus of
Suez.</p>

<p>It is maintained, in support of the claims of
Columbus, that he was the originator of the scheme
the success of which covered him with everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
glory, whilst Vasco da Gama simply obeyed the
behests of his King, when he took the lead of
an expedition which was to crown the efforts
made by little Portugal for generations past.</p>

<p>There is much truth in this contention. The
scheme of reaching the East by a westward course
across the Atlantic had no doubt been entertained
in Portugal in the reign of Affonso the African
[1438-81]. Fernão Martinz, the Royal Chaplain,
had discussed its prospects with Paolo Toscanelli,
when in Italy, and had been instructed to apply
for further particulars to the Florentine physician,
in response to which he had received the famous
letter of June 25th, 1474, and the chart which
accompanied it. But practically nothing was done,
except that an adventurer or two<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> were authorised
to seek for the islands supposed to lie to the
west of the Azores. Prince Henry the Navigator
would perhaps have acted upon such a suggestion,
had he been still alive, but the King’s resources
were devoted to Africa, or wasted in two disastrous
wars with Spain.</p>

<p>Columbus, on the other hand, made the discarded
scheme his own; he, too, applied to Toscanelli for
counsel,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and found confirmation of that physician’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>erroneous hypothesis as to the small breadth of the
Atlantic by studying the <i>Imago Mundi</i> of Cardinal
Pierre d’Ailly, and other writings. Nor did he
rest until he found in Queen Isabella the Catholic
a patron who enabled him to put his theories to the
test of practical experience. It was his good fortune
that Providence had placed the new world as a
barrier between him and Marco Polo’s Cipangu
(Japan), which was his goal, or he might never have
returned to claim the reward of his success.</p>

<p>On the accession of D. João II, in 1481, the
discovery of Africa was resumed with renewed
vigour, and the councillors of that King acted wisely
when they advised him to decline the offers of
Columbus,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> for the resources of Portugal were quite
unequal to pursuing at one and the same time
a search for a western route and continuing the
efforts for opening a practical route around the
southern extremity of Africa. And thus it happened
that Columbus “discovered a new world for
Castile and Leon”, and not for Portugal.</p>

<p>When, however, we come to consider the physical
difficulties which had to be overcome by these
great navigators in the accomplishment of their
purpose, the greater credit must undoubtedly be
awarded to Vasco da Gama. Columbus, trusting
as implicitly to the chart and sailing directions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>of Toscanelli as did Vasco da Gama to those of
Dias, and, perhaps, of Pero de Covilhão, shaped
a course westward of Gomera; and, having sailed
in that direction for thirty-six days, and for a
distance of 2,600 miles, made his first landfall at
Guanahani, being favoured all the while by the
prevailing easterly winds. The task which Vasco
da Gama undertook was far more difficult of
accomplishment. Instead of creeping along the
coast, as had been done by his predecessors, he
conceived the bold idea of shaping a course which
would take him direct through the mid-Atlantic
from the Cape Verde Islands to the Cape of Good
Hope. The direct distance to be covered was
3,770 miles, but the physical obstacles presented
by winds and currents could only be overcome
by taking a circuitous course, and thus it happened
that he spent ninety-three days at sea before he
made his first landfall to the north of the bay of
St. Helena. This first passage across the southern
Atlantic is one of the great achievements recorded
in the annals of maritime exploration.</p>

<p>Once beyond the Cape, Vasco had to struggle
against the Agulhas current, which had baffled
Bartholomeu Dias, and against the current of
Mozambique; and it was only after he had secured
a trustworthy pilot at Melinde that the difficulties
of the outward voyage can be said to have been
overcome.</p>

<p>In one other respect Vasco da Gama, or, perhaps,
we ought to say his pilots, proved themselves the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>
superiors of Columbus, namely, in the accuracy of
the charts of their discoveries which they brought
home to Portugal. Accepting the Cantino Chart<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
as a fair embodiment of the work done by this expedition,
we find that the greatest error in latitude
amounts to 1° 40´. The errors of Columbus were
far more considerable. In three places of his Journal
the latitude of the north coast of Cuba is stated to
be 42° by actual observation; and that this is no
clerical error, thrice repeated in three different
places, seems to be proved by the evidence of the
charts. On that of Juan de la Cosa, for instance,
Cuba is made to extend to lat. 35° N. (instead of
23° 10´), and even on the rough sketch drawn by
Bartolomeo Columbus after the return from the
Fourth Voyage, Jamaica and Puerto Rico (Spagnola)
are placed 6° too far to the north.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Verily, the Portuguese of those days were
superior as navigators to their Spanish rivals and
the Italians.</p>

<p>Posterity is fortunate in possessing a very full
abstract of the Journal which Columbus kept during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span>his first voyage to the West Indies.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> No such
trustworthy record is available in the case of Vasco
da Gama, whose original reports have disappeared.
They were consulted, no doubt, by João de Barros
and Damião de Goes; but these writers, much to
our loss, dealt very briefly with all that refers to
navigation. The only available account written
by a member of the expedition is the <i>Roteiro</i>
or Journal, a translation of which fills the bulk of
this volume, and of which, later on, we shall
speak at greater length. The only other contemporary
accounts, which we also reproduce, are at
second-hand, and are contained in the letters written
by King Manuel and Girolamo Sernigi immediately
after the return of Vasco da Gama’s vessels from
India.</p>

<p>Apart from these, our chief authorities regarding
this voyage are still the <i>Decades</i> of João
de Barros and the <i>Chronicle</i> of King Manuel, by
Damião de Goes. Both these authors held official
positions which gave them access to the records
preserved in the India House. Castanheda relied
almost wholly upon the <i>Roteiro</i>, but a few additional
statements of interest may be found in his
pages.</p>

<p>As to the <i>Lendas</i> of Gaspar Correa, we are unable
to look upon his account of Vasco da Gama’s first
voyage as anything but a jumble of truth and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>fiction,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> notwithstanding that he claims to have
made use of the diary of a priest, Figueiro, who is
stated to have sailed in Vasco’s fleet. Correa’s long
residence in India&mdash;from 1514 to the time of his
death&mdash;must have proved an advantage when relating
events which came under his personal observation,
but it also precluded him from consulting
the documents placed on record in the Archives
of Lisbon. This much is certain: that whoever
accepts Correa as his guide must reject the almost
unanimous evidence of other writers of authority
who have dealt with this important voyage.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>A few additional facts may be gleaned from
Faria y Sousa’s <i>Asia Portuguesa</i>, from Duarte
Pacheco Pereira and Antonio Galvão; but in the
main we are dependent upon the <i>Roteiro</i>, for recent
searches<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> in the <i>Torre do Tombo</i> have yielded
absolutely nothing, so far as we are aware, which
throws additional light upon Da Gama’s First
Voyage, with which alone we are concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span></p>

<p>And now we shall proceed to give an account of
the <i>Roteiro</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Manuscript of the “Roteiro”.</i></p>

<p>In giving an account of the manuscript of this
Journal, we entrust ourselves to the guidance of
Professors Kopke and Antonio da Costa Paiva, the
two gentlemen who first published it.</p>

<p>The manuscript originally belonged to the famous
Convent of Santa Cruz at Coimbra, whence it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span>
transferred, together with other precious MSS., to
the public library of Oporto.</p>

<p>It is not an autograph, for on fol. 64 (p. 77 of this
translation), where the author has left a blank, the
copyist, to guard against his being supposed to have
been careless in his task, has added these words:
“The author has omitted to tell us how these
weapons were made”. This copy, however, was
taken in the beginning of the sixteenth century,
as may be seen from the style of the writing as
exhibited in the facsimile of the first paragraph
of the work, shown on preceding page.</p>

<p>The MS. is in folio, and is rudely bound up in
a sheet of parchment, torn out of some book of
ecclesiastical offices. The ink is a little faded,
but the writing is still perfectly legible. The
paper is of ordinary strength, and of rather a dark
tint; the manufacturer’s water mark is shown in
the above facsimile. Blank leaves of more modern
make, and having a different water-mark, have been
inserted at the front and back, and the first of these
leaves contains the following inscription in a modern
hand, which is still legible, although pains have
been taken to erase it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center">
“Pertinet ad usum fratris Theotonii de Sancto<br />
G ... Canonici Regularis in Cenobio<br />
Scte Crucis”.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Immediately below this we read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">
“Dô Theotonio”,
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and near the bottom of the page, in a modern hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</a></span>
probably that of one of the librarians of the convent:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">
“Descobrimento da India por D. Vasco<br />
da Gamma”.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Prof. Kopke suggests<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> that the copyist of this
valuable MS. was the famous historian Fernão
Lopes de Castanheda, who was Apparitor and
Keeper of the Archives in the University of
Coimbra, and was engaged there during twenty
years, much to the injury of his health and private
fortune, in collecting the materials for his <i>Historia
do Descobrimento e Conquista da India</i>. In support
of this assumption he publishes a signature (see
the facsimile on page xxii) taken from a copy
of the first book of Castanheda’s history, published
in 1551. But A. Herculano,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> whilst admitting this
signature to be genuine, points out that the cursive
characters of the MS. are of a type exceedingly
common during the first half of the sixteenth century,
and that it would consequently not be safe
to attribute it to any writer in particular. Until,
therefore, further evidence is forthcoming, we cannot
accept the Professor’s theory that we are indebted
for this copy to Castanheda; though, as we
have already said, there can be no doubt that in
writing his account of the First Voyage of Vasco
da Gama he depended almost exclusively for his
facts upon the anonymous author of this <i>Roteiro</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">xxv</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>The Author of the “Roteiro”.</i></p>

<p>It is quite possible, as suggested by Prof. Kopke,
that the title by which the <i>Roteiro</i> was known at
the convent of Santa Cruz misled certain bibliographers
into a belief that Vasco da Gama himself
had written this account of his voyage.</p>

<p>Thus Nicoláo Antonio, in his <i>Bibliotheca Hispana
Veta</i> (1672), lib. 10, c. 15, § 543, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Vascus da Gama ... dedit reversus Emanueli suo Regi
populari Portugaliæ idiomate navigationis suae ad Indiam anno
<span class="smcap">MCDXCVII</span> relationem, quae lucem vidit.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The words “quae lucem vidit” need not, however,
be understood as conveying the meaning that this
narrative was actually printed and published, for the
same author, in his <i>Bibliotheca Hispana Nova</i>,
makes use of the same equivocal expression when
describing another voyage to India, expressly stated
by him to be still in MS.</p>

<p>Moreri, in his <i>Dictionnaire</i> (1732), quoting as
his authority a <i>Bibliotheca Portuguesa</i> in MS., which
he had from “a man of judgment and of vast erudition”,
states that Vasco da Gama is said to have
published an account of his first voyage to India,
but that no copy of it had up till then been discovered.</p>

<p>Similarly, Barbosa Machado, the author of the
standard <i>Bibliotheca Lusitana</i> (t. iii, p. 775), 1752,
accepting Nicoláo Antonio as his authority, says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</a></span>
that Vasco da Gama “wrote an account of the
voyage which he made to India in 1497”.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>We are quite safe in assuming that no such a
narrative has ever been published, although it is
equally certain that Vasco da Gama furnished official
reports of his proceedings, which were still available
when João de Barros wrote his <i>Decades</i>, but are so
no longer.</p>

<p class="tb">No one has yet succeeded in discovering the
author of the <i>Roteiro</i>. Prof. Kopke attempts to
arrive at the name by a process of elimination,
and in doing so starts with several assumptions
which we cannot accept. First of all he assumes
that Castanheda must have known the writer of the
MS. of which he made such excellent use in writing
his history. But Castanheda only became acquainted
with this MS. after 1530, when he took up his
residence at Coimbra on his return from India,
that is, more than thirty years after it had been
written. Of course, the author might then have
been still alive, notwithstanding the lapse of years;
but had this been the case, and had Castanheda
been personally acquainted with him, he would
surely have obtained from him an account of the
termination of the voyage, instead of abruptly
breaking off in the same way as the <i>Roteiro</i> does,
with the arrival of the fleet at the shoals of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</a></span>
Rio Grande (see p. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>), adding that he had been
unable to ascertain the particulars of the further
voyage of the captain-major, and only knew that
Coelho arrived at Cascaes on July 10th, 1499.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
It is probable, moreover, that if Castanheda had
known the name of the author to whom he was so
greatly indebted, he would have mentioned it in
his book.</p>

<p>Prof. Kopke assumes further that the writer was
a common sailor or soldier, and most probably the
former: first, because he frequently makes use of
the expression “nós outros” (we others) as if to
draw a distinction between the officers of the ships
and the class to which he himself belonged; and,
secondly, because “the style of his narrative would
seem to point to his humble condition”. We can
admit neither of these conclusions. The author
by no means uses the expression “we others” in
the restricted sense in which Prof. Kopke understands
it. In proof of this we may refer to such
sentences as are to be found at pp. 57 and 61:&mdash;“When
the King beckoned to the captain he looked
at us others”; “as to us others, we diverted ourselves”&mdash;the
“others”, in both these cases, including
the thirteen men who attended Vasco da Gama to
Calecut, and among whom were the three pursers,
the captain-major’s secretary, and others who may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</a></span>not have been “persons of distinction” but who
nevertheless cannot be classed with “common
soldiers or sailors”. As to the literary style of the
Journal, we may at once admit that its author cannot
take rank with Barros, Castanheda or Correa, but
this by no means proves him to have been an
uncultured man, or of “humble condition.” His
spelling may not have been quite in accordance with
the somewhat loose rules followed in the fifteenth
century, but his narrative is straightforward and to
the point, and shows that he was a man of judgment
perfectly able to give an intelligent account of the
many novel facts which came under his observation.
If he looked upon the Hindus as fellow-Christians,
he shared that opinion with the other members
of the expedition, including its chief. It only needs
a perusal of such a collection of letters, reports, and
narratives as is to be found in <i>Alguns documentos
do Archivo nacional</i> (Lisbon, 1892) to convince us
that there were men holding high positions in those
days whose literary abilities fell short of those which
can be claimed on behalf of our author. Moreover,
it is not likely that access to the information
required to enable him to write a <i>Roteiro da
Viagem</i> would have been given to a “common
sailor or soldier”, even if such a person had been
bold enough to ask for it.</p>

<p>We shall now follow Prof. Kopke in his “process
of elimination”:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The author, in the course of his narrative,
mentions a number of persons by name, and these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">xxix</a></span>
we must eliminate forthwith. They are: Vasco and
Paulo da Gama, Nicolau Coelho (p. 22), Pero
d’Alenquer (p. 5), João de Coimbra (p. 30), Martin
Affonso (pp. 12, 17), Sancho Mexia (p. 6), and
Fernão Veloso (p. 7).</p>

<p>2. We know further that the author served on
board the <i>S. Raphael</i>.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> This disposes of Gonçalo
Alvares and Diogo Dias<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> of the <i>S. Gabriel</i>; and of
Gonçalo Nunes, Pero Escolar, and Alvaro de Braga,
of the <i>Berrio</i>.</p>

<p>3. The author mentions certain things as having
been done by persons whose names he does not
give. The name of one of these is supplied by
Castanheda and Barros. We thus learn from Barros
that Fernão Martins was the sailor mentioned by
the author (p. 23) as being able to speak the
language of the Moors; and from Castanheda (I,
p. 51) that he was one of the two men sent with a
message to the King of Calecut (p. 50). The
convict who was sent to Calecut on May 21st
(p. 48) was João Nunez, according to Correa.
The author states (p. 64, line 18, and p. 65, last
line) that the captain-major sent three men along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">xxx</a></span>the beach in search of the ships’ boats. According
to Castanheda (I, pp. 71 and 72), one of these men
was Gonçalo Pires.</p>

<p>We may therefore strike out all these names from
the list of possible authors.</p>

<p>4. Three members of the expedition are reported
to have died during the voyage, namely, Pedro de
Covilhão, the priest; Pedro de Faria de Figueredo,
and his brother Francisco, all of them mentioned
by Faria y Sousa alone.</p>

<p>5. Lastly, there are four convicts whose names
are given by Correa, none of whom is likely to
have been the author of the MS. The presence of
some of these convicts is, moreover, very doubtful.</p>

<p>We have thus accounted for all the members of
the expedition whose names are known, with the
exception of eight.</p>

<p>Four of these&mdash;João de Sá, Alvaro Velho, João
Palha and João de Setubal&mdash;are stated to have been
among the thirteen who attended Vasco da Gama to
Calecut (p. 51), and of these, João de Sá was clerk
in the <i>S. Raphael</i>, the author’s ship. He certainly
might have been the author. Prof. Kopke thinks
not, first, because of the author’s supposed humble
position; secondly, because. João de Sá, if we may
credit an anecdote recorded by Castanheda (I, p. 57),<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
had his doubts about the people of India being
Christians, whilst the author unhesitatingly affirms
them to be so. The only other person mentioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">xxxi</a></span>by Castanheda as having been connected with the
expedition is Alvaro Velho, a soldier, who, according
to Prof. Kopke, may “fairly be looked upon as the
author of this Journal.” He admits, however, that
this conclusion is acceptable only on the assumption
that Castanheda knew the author: a purely gratuitous
assumption, in our opinion.</p>

<p>Castanheda only mentions six out of the thirteen
who were present at Vasco da Gama’s audience of
the Zamorin. Correa mentions two others&mdash;João
de Setubal and João Palha. Five remain thus to
be accounted for; and, although these may have
included servants and trumpeters, not likely to have
troubled about keeping a journal, our author may
have been among them. It will thus be seen that
this process of elimination has led to no result, and
that we cannot even tell whether the author’s name
occurs in any single account of this expedition.
Comparing his “Journal” with the contents of Sernigi’s
first letter, it almost seems as if he had been the
person from whom the Florentine derived the bulk
of his information. In that case his name may
perhaps turn up some day in the Italian archives.
If our choice were limited to Alvaro Velho and
João de Sá, we should feel inclined to decide in
favour of the latter.</p>

<p>Correa mentions three other persons as having
been with Vasco da Gama: namely, João Figueiro,
whose diary he claims to have used, and who cannot
therefore have been the author of a “Journal” the
contents of which are so widely different; André<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">xxxii</a></span>
Gonçalves and João d’Amoxeira. Camões adds a
fourth name, that of Leonardo Ribeyra. This
exhausts the muster-roll, as far as the names are
known to us.</p>

<p class="center mart2"><i>The Portuguese Editions of the “Roteiro”.</i><a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>The <i>Roteiro</i> was printed for the first time in 1838.
The editors, Diogo Kopke and Dr. Antonio da
Costa Paiva, both teachers at the <i>Academia Polytechnica</i>
of Oporto, furnished it with an introduction,
in which they give an account of the manuscript
and discuss its authorship, add sixty-nine notes,
explanatory of the text, and append King Manuel’s
letters patent of January 10th, 1502 (see p. <a href="#Page_230">230</a>). The
illustrations include a map, the facsimile of a page
of the MS., a portrait, and an illustrated title-page of
poor design. The book was published by subscription.
Three hundred and ninety-two copies were
subscribed for, including two hundred and thirty-seven
by residents in Oporto, among whom British
wine-merchants figure prominently. Only five copies
went abroad, and three of these were subscribed
for by Captain Washington, R.N., the Royal Geographical
Society, and the Geographical Society of
Paris.</p>

<p>A second edition appeared at Lisbon in 1861.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</a></span>Its editors, A. Herculano, the famous historian, and
Baron do Castello de Paiva, claim to have “got rid
of those imperfections in the text, as also in the notes
of the first edition,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> which must be attributed to the
inexperience of the editors, and to their eagerness
to bring before the public so precious an historical
document”. Their emendations, however, are not
of a kind to justify this somewhat brutal reference to
the work done by their predecessors. They consist,
in the main, of a modernisation of the spelling, the
introduction of a few “philological” notes of no particular
interest, and a short preface in which Correa’s
<i>Lendas da India</i> are spoken of in terms of eulogy.
These <i>Lendas</i> the editors consider to be “far
superior in substance (<i>quanto á substancia</i>) to the
<i>Decades</i> of João de Barros, and to the exuberant but
evidently honest narrative of Castanheda.” After
praising Correa “for depicting in firm contours and
vivid colours” the human passions brought into play
by close companionship within the narrow limits of a
ship, they admit that as to “facts” “he is often vague,
forgetful, or ambiguous”. They conclude by saying
that the author of the <i>Roteiro</i> and the chronicle-writers
mutually complement each other, and jointly
acquaint us with all the details of one of the great
events in the history of modern nations.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p class="center mart2"><i>The French Translations of the “Roteiro”.</i></p>

<p>Two have been published. The first of these, by
M. Ferdinand Denis, will be found in the third
volume of Charton’s <i>Voyageurs Anciens et Modernes</i>,
Paris, 1855. It is based upon the first Portuguese
edition, and ends with the arrival of the two vessels
at the Rio Grande. The notes by Professor Kopke
are embodied in those of the translator, who has
added an introduction, giving a short but excellent
biography of Vasco da Gama, and a bibliography.
The map of the original is retained, and there are
twenty illustrations, including two portraits of Vasco
da Gama, the one stated to be from Count Farrobo’s
painting, as published in the <i>Panorama</i>, the other
from a Paris MS. of Barretto de Rezende.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>For the second French translation<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> we are indebted
to M. Arthur Morelet. It is from the
second Portuguese edition, and not a word of either
text or notes has been omitted. The translator has
confined himself to supplying a short introduction.
The map is retained, but a free rendering of Count
Farrobo’s painting<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> has been substituted for the
poor portrait of Vasco da Gama in the original,
and the portrait of King Manuel has been omitted
as being “flat, without relief and vigour, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">xxxv</a></span>wanting even in that unaffected simplicity which
marks the works of that period.”<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p class="center mart2"><i>The English Translation.</i></p>

<p>In 1869 the Hakluyt Society published Lord
Stanley of Alderley’s translation of the <i>Three
Voyages of Vasco da Gama</i>, from the <i>Lendas</i> of
Gaspar Correa, with numerous foot-notes indicating
those instances in which Correa differs from Barros,
Goes, Castanheda and other historians, as well as
from the poetical version of this voyage presented
in the <i>Lusiadas</i> of Camões.</p>

<p>It was intended at the same time to bring out an
English version of the <i>Roteiro</i>, but no definite
arrangements were made, and thus the matter was
left in abeyance until the present Editor revived
the idea, and suggested that the volume proposed
might prove acceptable as an interesting though
humble contribution to the literature of the Fourth
Centenary of Vasco da Gama’s arrival in India,
which Portugal is about to celebrate.</p>

<p>The translation of the <i>Roteiro</i> itself is literal and
complete. The notes of the Portuguese editors
have, however, been abridged, and only the substance
of what they say in their introductions has
been retained.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Editor has added translations
of the letters of King Manuel and Sernigi, and of
three Portuguese accounts of the voyage. He has,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">xxxvi</a></span>moreover, added Appendices, among which the one
dealing with early maps will, he hopes, prove of
some interest.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Editor fulfils an agreeable duty
in acknowledging the kindly help and advice extended
to him by a number of gentlemen. To
Capt. E. J. de Carvalho e Vasconcellos and Senhor
José Bastos, of Lisbon, he is indebted for the fine
portraits which ornament this edition; to Prof.
Gallois for a tracing of the unpublished portion of
Canerio’s chart; to Dr. M. C. Caputo for a photograph
of the African portion of the Cantino chart;
to Prof. Biagi for a copy of Sernigi’s letter in
the <i>Biblioteca Riccardiana</i>; to Sir J. Kirk for
several illustrations and important notes; to the late
Rt. Rev. Dr. J. M. Speechley, and the Rev. J. J.
Jaus, of the Basel Missionary Society, for notes on
Calecut; and for help in minor matters to Dr.
Garnett, of the British Museum; Baron Hulot,
Secretary of the Paris Geographical Society; M.
Marcel, of the <i>Bibliothèque Nationale</i>; Prof. Dalla
Vedova, of Rome; Prof. Berchet, of Venice; and
Capt. B. B. da Silva, of Lisbon.</p>

<p>His special thanks are due to three members of
the Hakluyt Society, namely, Sir Clements Markham,
the President; Admiral Albert H. Markham,
who acted as the Editor’s nautical adviser; and Mr.
William Foster, the Secretary, whose careful reading
of the proofs kept this volume free from many a
blunder.</p>

<p>In the year 1497 King Dom
Manuel, the first of that name in
Portugal, despatched four vessels to
make discoveries and go in search
of spices. Vasco da Gama was the

brother, commanded one of them, and Nicolau Coelho
another.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>We left Restello<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> on Saturday, July 8, 1497. May God

Amen!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>On the following Saturday [July 15] we sighted the
Canaries, and in the night passed to the lee of Lançarote.
During the following night, at break of day [July 16] we
made the Terra Alta, where we fished for a couple of
hours, and in the evening, at dusk, we were off the Rio
do Ouro.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>The fog<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> during the night grew so dense that Paulo da
Gama lost sight of the captain-major, and when day broke
[July 17] we saw neither him nor the other vessels. We
therefore made sail for the Cape Verde islands, as we had
been instructed to do in case of becoming separated.</p>

<p>On the following Saturday, [July 22], at break of day,
we sighted the Ilha do Sal,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> and an hour afterwards discovered
three vessels, which turned out to be the store-ship,
and the vessels commanded by Nicolau Coelho and
Bartholameu Diz [Dias], the last of whom sailed in our
company as far as the Mine.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> They, too, had lost sight of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>the captain-major. Having joined company we pursued
our route, but the wind fell, and we were becalmed until
Wednesday [July 26]. At ten o’clock on that day we
sighted the captain-major, about five leagues ahead of us,
and having got speech with him in the evening we gave
expression to our joy by many times firing off our bombards<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>
and sounding the trumpets.</p>

<p>The day after this, a Thursday [July 27], we arrived at
the island of Samtiago [São Thiago],<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> and joyfully anchored
in the bay of Santa Maria, where we took on board meat,
water and wood, and did the much-needed repairs to
our yards.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Across the Southern Atlantic.</i>]</p>

<p>On Thursday, August 3, we left in an easterly direction.
On August 18,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> when about 200 leagues from Samtiaguo,
going south, the captain-major’s main yard broke, and we
lay to under foresail and mainsail for two days and
a night. On the 22nd of the same month, when going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>S. by W., we saw many birds resembling herons.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> On
the approach of night they flew vigorously to the S.S.E., as
if making for the land.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> On the same day, being then
quite 800 leagues out at sea [<i>i.e.</i>, reckoning from S. Thiago],
we saw a whale.</p>

<p>On Friday, October 27, the eve of St. Simon and Jude,
we saw many whales, as also quoquas<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> and seals.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>On Wednesday, November 1, the day of All Saints, we
perceived many indications of the neighbourhood of land,
including gulf-weed,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> which grows along the coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>On Saturday, the 4th of the same month, a couple of
hours before break of day, we had soundings in 110
fathoms,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> and at nine o’clock we sighted the land.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> We
then drew near to each other, and having put on our gala
clothes, we saluted the captain-major by firing our bombards,
and dressed the ships with flags and standards. In
the course of the day we tacked so as to come close to the
land, but as we failed to identify it, we again stood out
to sea.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>The Bay of St. Helena.</i>]</p>

<p>On Tuesday [November 7] we returned to the land,
which we found to be low, with a broad bay opening into
it. The captain-major sent Pero d’Alenquer<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> in a boat to
take soundings and to search for good anchoring ground.
The bay was found to be very clean, and to afford shelter
against all winds except those from the N.W. It extended
east and west, and we named it Santa Helena.</p>

<p>On Wednesday [November 8] we cast anchor in this
bay, and we remained there eight days, cleaning the ships,
mending the sails, and taking in wood.</p>

<p>The river Samtiagua [S. Thiago]<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> enters the bay four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>leagues to the S.E. of the anchorage. It comes from the
interior (sertão), is about a stone’s throw across at the
mouth, and from two to three fathoms in depth at all states
of the tide.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>The inhabitants of this country are tawny-coloured.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
Their food is confined to the flesh of seals, whales and
gazelles, and the roots of herbs. They are dressed in skins,
and wear sheaths over their virile members.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> They are
armed with poles of olive wood to which a horn, browned
in the fire, is attached.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> Their numerous dogs resemble
those of Portugal, and bark like them. The birds of the
country, likewise, are the same as in Portugal, and include
cormorants, gulls, turtle doves, crested larks, and many
others. The climate is healthy and temperate, and produces
good herbage.</p>

<p>On the day after we had cast anchor, that is to say on
Thursday [November 9], we landed with the captain-major,
and made captive one of the natives, who was small of
stature like Sancho Mexia. This man had been gathering
honey in the sandy waste, for in this country the bees
deposit their honey at the foot of the mounds around the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>bushes. He was taken on board the captain-major’s ship,
and being placed at table he ate of all we ate. On the
following day the captain-major had him well dressed and
sent ashore.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>On the following day [November 10] fourteen or fifteen
natives came to where our ships lay. The captain-major
landed and showed them a variety of merchandise, with
the view of finding out whether such things were to
be found in their country. This merchandise included
cinnamon, cloves, seed-pearls, gold, and many other things,
but it was evident that they had no knowledge whatever of
such articles, and they were consequently given round bells
and tin rings. This happened on Friday, and the like
took place on Saturday.</p>

<p>On Sunday [November 12] about forty or fifty natives
made their appearance, and having dined, we landed, and
in exchange for the çeitils<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> with which we came provided,
we obtained shells, which they wore as ornaments in their
ears, and which looked as if they had been plated, and fox-tails
attached to a handle, with which they fanned their
faces. I also acquired for one çeitil one of the sheaths
which they wore over their members, and this seemed to
show that they valued copper very highly; indeed, they
wore small beads of that metal in their ears.</p>

<p>On that day Fernão Velloso, who was with the captain-major,
expressed a great desire to be permitted to accompany
the natives to their houses, so that he might find out
how they lived and what they ate. The captain-major
yielded to his importunities, and allowed him to accompany
them, and when we returned to the captain-major’s vessel
to sup, he went away with the negroes. Soon after they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>had left us they caught a seal, and when they came to the
foot of a hill in a barren place they roasted it, and gave
some of it to Fernão Velloso, as also some of the roots
which they eat. After this meal they expressed a desire
that he should not accompany them any further, but return
to the vessels. When Fernão Velloso came abreast of the
vessels he began to shout, the negroes keeping in the bush.</p>

<p>We were still at supper; but when his shouts were
heard the captain-major rose at once, and so did we others,
and we entered a sailing boat. The negroes then began
running along the beach, and they came as quickly up with
Fernão Velloso<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> as we did, and when we endeavoured to
get him into the boat they threw their assegais, and
wounded the captain-major and three or four others. All
this happened because we looked upon these people as
men of little spirit, quite incapable of violence, and had
therefore landed without first arming ourselves. We then
returned to the ships.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Rounding the Cape</i>].</p>

<p>At daybreak of Thursday the 16th of November, having
careened our ships and taken in wood, we set sail. At that
time we did not know how far we might be abaft the Cape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>of Good Hope. Pero d’Alenquer thought the distance
about thirty leagues,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> but he was not certain, for on his
return voyage [when with B. Dias] he had left the Cape in
the morning and had gone past this bay with the wind
astern, whilst on the outward voyage he had kept at sea,
and was therefore unable to identify the locality where
we now were. We therefore stood out towards the S.S.W.
and late on Saturday [November 18] we beheld the Cape.
On that same day we again stood out to sea, returning to
the land in the course of the night. On Sunday morning,
November 19, we once more made for the Cape, but were
again unable to round it, for the wind blew from the S.S.W.,
whilst the Cape juts out towards the S.W. We then
again stood out to sea, returning to the land on Monday
night. At last, on Wednesday [November 22], at noon,
having the wind astern, we succeeded in doubling the Cape,
and then ran along the coast.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>To the south of this Cape of Good Hope, and close to it,
a vast bay, six leagues broad at its mouth, enters about six
leagues into the land.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>The Bay of São Braz</i>].<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>Late on Saturday, November 25, the day of St.
Catherine’s, we entered the bay (angra) of Sam Brás,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>where we remained for thirteen days, for there we broke
up our store-ship and transferred her contents to the other
vessels.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>On Friday [December 1], whilst still in the bay of Sam
Brás, about ninety men resembling those we had met at
St. Helena Bay made their appearance. Some of them
walked along the beach, whilst others remained upon the
hills. All, or most of us, were at the time in the captain-major’s
vessel. As soon as we saw them we launched and
armed the boats, and started for the land. When close to
the shore the captain-major threw them little round bells,
which they picked up. They even ventured to approach
us, and took some of these bells from the captain-major’s
hand. This surprised us greatly, for when Bartholomeu
Dias<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> was here the natives fled without taking any of the
objects which he offered them. Nay, on one occasion,
when Dias was taking in water, close to the beach, they
sought to prevent him, and when they pelted him with
stones, from a hill, he killed one of them with the arrow of
a cross-bow. It appeared to us that they did not fly on
this occasion, because they had heard from the people at
the bay of St. Helena (only sixty leagues distant by sea)<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>
that there was no harm in us, and that we even gave away
things which were ours.</p>

<p>The captain-major did not land at this spot, because
there was much bush, but proceeded to an open part of the
beach, when he made signs to the negroes to approach.
This they did. The captain-major and the other cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>tains
then landed, being attended by armed men, some of
whom carried cross-bows. He then made the negroes
understand, by signs, that they were to disperse, and to
approach him only singly or in couples. To those who
approached he gave small bells and red caps, in return for
which they presented him with ivory bracelets, such as
they wore on their arms, for it appears that elephants are
plentiful in this country. We actually found some of their
droppings near the watering place where they had gone
to drink.</p>

<p>On Saturday [December 2] about two hundred negroes
came, both young and old. They brought with them about
a dozen oxen and cows and four or five sheep. As soon
as we saw them we went ashore. They forthwith began to
play on four or five flutes,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> some producing high notes and
others low ones, thus making a pretty harmony for negroes
who are not expected to be musicians; and they danced
in the style of negroes. The captain-major then ordered
the trumpets to be sounded, and we, in the boats, danced,
and the captain-major did so likewise when he rejoined
us. This festivity ended, we landed where we had landed
before, and bought a black ox for three bracelets. This ox
we dined off on Sunday. We found him very fat, and his
meat as toothsome as the beef of Portugal.</p>

<p>On Sunday [December 3] many visitors came, and brought
with them their women and little boys, the women remaining
on the top of a hill near the sea. They had with them
many oxen and cows. Having collected in two spots on
the beach, they played and danced as they had done on
Saturday. It is the custom of this people for the young
men to remain in the bush with their weapons. The
[older] men came to converse with us. They carried a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>short stick in the hand, attached to which was a fox’s
tail, with which they fan the face. Whilst conversing with
them, by signs, we observed the young men crouching in
the bush, holding their weapons in their hands. The
captain-major then ordered Martin Affonso, who had
formerly been in Manicongo [Congo] to advance, and to
buy an ox, for which purpose he was supplied with bracelets.
The natives, having accepted the bracelets, took him by
the hand, and, pointing to the watering place, asked him
why we took away their water, and simultaneously drove
their cattle into the bush. When the captain-major
observed this he ordered us to gather together, and called
upon Martin Affonso to retreat, for he suspected some
treachery. Having drawn together we proceeded [in our
boats] to the place where we had been at first. The negroes
followed us. The captain-major then ordered us to land,
armed with lances, assegais, and strung cross-bows, and
wearing our breast-plates, for he wanted to show that we
had the means of doing them an injury, although we had
no desire to employ them. When they observed this they
ran away. The captain-major, anxious that none should
be killed by mischance, ordered the boats to draw together;
but to prove that we were able, although unwilling to hurt
them, he ordered two bombards to be fired from the poop
of the long boat. They were by that time all seated close
to the bush, not far from the beach, but the first discharge
caused them to retreat so precipitately that in their flight
they dropped the skins with which they were covered and
their weapons. When they were in the bush two of them
turned back to pick up the articles which had been dropped.
They then continued their flight to the top of a hill, driving
their cattle before them.</p>

<p>The oxen of this country are as large as those of Alemtejo,
wonderfully fat and very tame. They are geldings,
and hornless. Upon the fattest among them the negroes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
place a packsaddle made of reeds, as is done in Castille,
and upon this saddle they place a kind of litter made of
sticks, upon which they ride. If they wish to sell an
ox they pass a stick through his nostrils, and thus lead
him.</p>

<p>There is an island in this bay, three bowshots from the
land, where there are many seals.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> Some of these are as
big as bears, very formidable, with large tusks. These
attack man, and no spear, whatever the force with
which it is thrown, can wound them. There are others
much smaller and others quite small. And whilst the big
ones roar like lions, the little ones cry like goats. One day,
when we approached this island for our amusement, we
counted, among large and small ones, three thousand, and
we fired among them with our bombards from the sea.
On the same island there are birds as big as ducks, but
they cannot fly, because they have no feathers on their
wings. These birds, of whom we killed as many as we
chose, are called Fotylicayos, and they bray like asses.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>Whilst taking in water in this bay of Sam Brás, on a
Wednesday, we erected a cross and a pillar.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> The cross was
made out of a mizzen-mast, and very high. On the following
Thursday [December 7], when about to set sail, we
saw about ten or twelve negroes, who demolished both the
cross and the pillar before we had left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>São Braz to Natal.</i>]</p>

<p>Having taken on board all we stood in need of we took
our departure, but as the wind failed us we anchored the
same day, having proceeded only two leagues.</p>

<p>On Friday morning, the day of the Immaculate Concepcion
[December 8], we again set sail. On Tuesday
[December 12], the eve of Santa Lucia, we encountered a
great storm, and ran before a stern-wind with the foresail
much lowered. On that day we lost sight of Nicolau
Coelho, but at sunset we saw him from the top four or five
leagues astern, and it seemed as if he saw us too. We
exhibited signal lights and lay to. By the end of the first
watch he had come up with us, not because he had seen
us during the day, but because the wind, being scant, he
could not help coming in our waters.</p>

<p>On the morning of Friday [December 15] we saw the
land near the Ilhéos chãos (Flat Islands). These are five
leagues beyond the Ilhéo da Cruz (Cross Island). From
the Bay of Sam Brás to Cross Island is a distance of
sixty leagues, and as much from the Cape of Good Hope
to the Bay of Sam Brás. From the Flat Islands to the
last pillar erected by Bartholomeu Dias is five leagues,
and from this pillar to the Rio do Infante is fifteen
leagues.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>On Saturday [December 16] we passed the last pillar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>and as we ran along the coast we observed two men
running along the beach in a direction contrary to that
which we followed. The country about here is very charming
and well wooded; we saw much cattle, and the further
we advanced the more did the character of the country
improve, and the trees increase in size.</p>

<p>During the following night we lay to. We were then
already beyond the last discovery made by Bartholomeu
Dias.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> On the next day [December 17], till vespers, we
sailed along the coast before a stern-wind, when the wind
springing round to the east we stood out to sea. And thus
we kept making tacks until sunset on Tuesday [December
19], when the wind again veered to the west. We then
lay to during the night, in order that we might on the
following day examine the coast and find out where we
were.</p>

<p>In the morning [December 20] we made straight for the
land, and at ten o’clock found ourselves once more at the
Ilhéo da Cruz (Cross Island), that is sixty leagues abaft
our dead reckoning! This was due to the currents, which
are very strong here.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>That very day we again went forward by the route we
had already attempted, and being favoured during three or
four days by a strong stern-wind, we were able to overcome
the currents which we had feared might frustrate our
plans. Henceforth it pleased God in His mercy to allow
us to make headway! We were not again driven back.
May it please Him that it be thus alway!</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Natal.</i>]</p>

<p>By Christmas Day, the 25th of December, we had discovered
seventy leagues of coast [beyond Dias’ furthest].
On that day, after dinner, when setting a bonnet we discovered the
mast was sprung ... and ... secured it with lashings
below the top, and that the crack opened and shut. We
patched it up with backstays, hoping to be able to repair
it thoroughly as soon as we should reach a sheltered port.</p>

<p>On Thursday [December 28] we anchored near the
coast, and took much fish.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> At sunset we again set sail
and pursued our route. At that place the mooring-rope
snapped and we lost an anchor.</p>

<p>We now went so far out to sea, without touching any
port, that drinking-water began to fail us, and our food
had to be cooked with salt water. Our daily ration of
water was reduced to a quartilho.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> It thus became necessary
to seek a port.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Terra da boa Gente and Rio do Cobre.</i>]</p>

<p>On Thursday, January 11th [1498]<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> we discovered a
small river and anchored near the coast. On the following
day we went close in shore in our boats, and saw a crowd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>of negroes, both men and women. They were tall people,
and a chief (“Senhor”) was among them. The captain-major
ordered Martin Affonso, who had been a long time
in Manicongo, and another man, to land. They were
received hospitably. The captain-major in consequence
sent the chief a jacket, a pair of red pantaloons, a Moorish
cap and a bracelet. The chief said that we were welcome
to anything in his country of which we stood in need: at
least this is how Martin Affonso understood him. That
night, Martin Affonso and his companion accompanied
the chief to his village, whilst we returned to the ships.
On the road the chief donned the garments which had been
presented to him, and to those who came forth to meet
him he said with much apparent satisfaction, “Look, what
has been given to me!” The people upon this clapped
hands as a sign of courtesy, and this they did three or four
times until he arrived at the village. Having paraded the
whole of the place, thus dressed up, the chief retired to his
house, and ordered his two guests to be lodged in a
compound, where they were given porridge of millet, which
abounds in that country, and a fowl, just like those of
Portugal. All the night through, numbers of men and
women came to have a look at them. In the morning the
chief visited them, and asked them to go back to the ships.
He ordered two men to accompany them, and gave them
fowls as a present for the captain-major, telling them at
the same time that he would show the things that had
been given him to a great chief, who appears to be the
king of that country. When our men reached the landing
place where our boats awaited them, they were attended
by quite two hundred men, who had come to see them.</p>

<p>This country seemed to us to be densely peopled. There
are many chiefs,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> and the number of women seems to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>greater than that of the men, for among those who came to
see us there were forty women to every twenty men.
The houses are built of straw. The arms of the people
include long bows and arrows and spears with iron blades.
Copper seems to be plentiful, for the people wore [ornaments]
of it on their legs and arms and in their twisted
hair. Tin, likewise, is found in the country, for it is to be seen
on the hilts of their daggers, the sheaths of which are made
of ivory. Linen cloth is highly prized by the people, who
were always willing to give large quantities of copper in
exchange for shirts. They have large calabashes in which
they carry sea-water inland, where they pour it into pits, to
obtain the salt [by evaporation].</p>

<p>We stayed five days at this place, taking in water, which
our visitors conveyed to our boats. Our stay was not,
however, sufficiently prolonged to enable us to take in as
much water as we really needed, for the wind favoured a
prosecution of our voyage.</p>

<p>We were at anchor here, near the coast, exposed to the
swell of the sea. We called the country <i>Terra da Boa Gente</i>
(land of good people), and the river <i>Rio do Cobre</i> (copper
river).<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Rio dos Bons Signaes.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>On Monday [January 22] we discovered a low coast
thickly wooded with tall trees. Continuing our course we
perceived the broad mouth of a river. As it was necessary
to find out where we were, we cast anchor. On Thursday
[January 25], at night, we entered. The <i>Berrio</i> was
already there, having entered the night before&mdash;that is eight
days before the end of January [<i>i.e.</i>, January 24.]<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>The country is low and marshy, and covered with tall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>trees yielding an abundance of various fruits, which the
inhabitants eat.</p>

<p>These people are black and well made. They go naked,
merely wearing a piece of cotton stuff around their loins,
that worn by the women being larger than that worn by the
men. The young women are good-looking. Their lips
are pierced in three places, and they wear in them bits of
twisted tin. These people took much delight in us. They
brought us in their <i>almadias</i><a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> what they had, whilst we
went into their village to procure water.</p>

<p>When we had been two or three days at this place
two gentlemen (senhores) of the country came to see us.
They were very haughty, and valued nothing which we
gave them. One of them wore a <i>touca</i>,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> with a fringe
embroidered in silk, and the other a cap of green satin. A
young man in their company&mdash;so we understood from their
signs&mdash;had come from a distant country, and had already
seen big ships like ours. These tokens (signaes) gladdened
our hearts, for it appeared as if we were really
approaching the bourne of our desires. These gentlemen
had some huts built on the river bank, close to the ships,
in which they stayed seven days, sending daily to the ships,
offering to barter cloths which bore a mark of red ochre.
And when they were tired of being there, they left in their
<i>almadias</i> for the upper river.</p>

<p>As to ourselves, we spent thirty-two days<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> in the river
taking in water, careening the ships,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> and repairing the mast
of the <i>Raphael</i>. Many of our men fell ill here, their feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>and hands swelling, and their gums growing over their teeth,
so that they could not eat.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>We erected here a pillar which we called the pillar of
St. Raphael,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> because it had been brought in the ship
bearing that name. The river we called Rio dos Bons
Signaes (River of good signs or tokens).</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>To Moçambique.</i>]</p>

<p>On Saturday [February 24] we left this place and gained
the open sea. During the night we stood N.E., so as to
keep away from the land, which was very pleasing to look
upon. On Sunday [February 25] we still stood N.E., and
at vesper time discovered three small islands, out in the
open, of which two were covered with tall trees, while the
third and smallest was barren. The distance from one
island to the other was four leagues.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>On the following day we pursued our route, and did so
during six days, lying to at night.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>On Thursday, the 1st of March, we sighted islands and
the mainland, but as it was late we again stood out to sea,
and lay to till morning. We then approached the land, of
which I shall speak in what follows.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Moçambique.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>On Friday morning [March 2] Nicolau Coelho, when
attempting to enter the bay, mistook the channel and came
upon a bank in tacking towards the other ships, which were astern, Coelho perceived some
sailing boats approaching from a village on this island, in
order to welcome the captain-major and his brother. As
for ourselves we continued in the direction of our proposed
anchorage, these boats following us all the while, and
making signs for us to stop. When we had cast anchor in
the roadstead of the island from which these boats had
come, there approached seven or eight of them, including
<i>almadias</i>, the people in them playing upon <i>anafils</i>.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> They
invited us to proceed further into the bay, offering to take us
into port if we desired it. Those among them who
boarded our ships ate and drank what we did, and went
their way when they were satisfied.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>The captain thought that we should enter this bay in
order that we might find out what sort of people we had to
deal with; that Nicolau Coelho should go first in his vessel,
to take soundings at the entrance, and that, if found practicable,
we should follow him. As Coelho prepared to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>enter he struck the point of the island and broke his helm,
but he immediately disengaged himself and regained deep
water. I was with him at the time. When we were again
in deep water we struck our sails and cast anchor at a
distance of two bowshots from the village.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>The people of this country are of a ruddy complexion<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>
and well made. They are Mohammedans, and their language
is the same as that of the Moors.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> Their dresses
are of fine linen or cotton stuffs, with variously coloured
stripes, and of rich and elaborate workmanship. They all
wear <i>toucas</i> with borders of silk embroidered in gold.
They are merchants, and have transactions with white
Moors, four of whose vessels were at the time in port,
laden with gold, silver, cloves, pepper, ginger, and silver
rings, as also with quantities of pearls, jewels,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> and rubies,
all of which articles are used by the people of this country.
We understood them to say that all these things, with
the exception of the gold, were brought thither by these
Moors; that further on, where we were going to, they
abounded, and that precious stones, pearls and spices were
so plentiful that there was no need to purchase them as
they could be collected in baskets. All this we learned
through a sailor the captain-major had with him, and who,
having formerly been a prisoner among the Moors, understood
their language.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>These Moors, moreover, told us that along the route which
we were about to follow we should meet with numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>shoals; that there were many cities along the coast, and
also an island, one half the population of which consisted
of Moors and the other half of Christians,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> who were at
war with each other. This island was said to be very
wealthy.</p>

<p>We were told, morever, that Prester John<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> resided not far
from this place; that he held many cities along the coast,
and that the inhabitants of those cities were great merchants
and owned big ships. The residence of Prester
John was said to be far in the interior, and could be reached
only on the back of camels. These Moors had also brought
hither two Christian captives from India.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> This information,
and many other things which we heard, rendered
us so happy that we cried with joy, and prayed God to
grant us health, so that we might behold what we so much
desired.</p>

<p>In this place and island of Moncobiquy [Moçambique]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>there resided a chief [senhor] who had the title of Sultan,
and was like a vice-roy.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> He often came aboard our ships
attended by some of his people. The captain-major gave
him many good things to eat, and made him a present of
hats, <i>marlotas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> corals and many other articles. He was,
however, so proud that he treated all we gave him with
contempt, and asked for scarlet cloth, of which we had
none. We gave him, however, of all the things we had.</p>

<p>One day the captain-major invited him to a repast, when
there was an abundance of figs and comfits, and begged
him for two pilots to go with us. He at once granted this
request, subject to our coming to terms with them. The
captain-major gave each of them thirty mitkals<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> in gold
and two <i>marlotas</i>, on condition that from the day on which
they received this payment one of them should always
remain on board if the other desired to go on land. With
these terms they were well satisfied.</p>

<p>On Saturday, March 10, we set sail and anchored one
league out at sea, close to an island,<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> where mass was
said on Sunday, when those who wished to do so confessed
and joined in the communion.</p>

<p>One of our pilots lived on the island, and when we had
anchored we armed two boats to go in search of him.
The captain-major went in one boat and Nicolau Coelho
in the other. They were met by five or six boats (barcas)
coming from the island, and crowded with people armed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>with bows and long arrows and bucklers,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> who gave them
to understand by signs that they were to return to the
town. When the captain saw this he secured the pilot
whom he had taken with him, and ordered the bombards
to fire upon the boats. Paulo da Gama, who had remained
with the ships, so as to be prepared to render succour in
case of need, no sooner heard the reports of the bombards
than he started in the <i>Berrio</i>. The Moors, who were
already flying, fled still faster, and gained the land before
the <i>Berrio</i> was able to come up with them. We then
returned to our anchorage.</p>

<p class="tb">The vessels of this country are of good size and decked.
There are no nails, and the planks are held together by
cords,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> as are also those of their boats (barcos). The sails
are made of palm-matting.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> Their mariners have Genoese
needles,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> by which they steer, quadrants, and navigating
charts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>The palms of this country yield a fruit as large as a
melon, of which the kernel is eaten.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> It has a nutty flavour.
There also grow in abundance melons and cucumbers,
which were brought to us for barter.</p>

<p class="tb">On the day in which Nicolau Coelho entered the port,
the Lord of the place came on board with a numerous
suite. He was received well, and Coelho presented him
with a red hood, in return for which the Lord handed him
a black rosary, which he made use of when saying his
prayers, to be held as a pledge. He then begged Nicolau
Coelho for the use of his boat, to take him ashore. This
was granted. And after he had landed he invited those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>who had accompanied him to his house, where he gave them
to eat. He then dismissed them, giving them a jar of
bruised dates made into a preserve with cloves and cumin,
as a present for Nicolau Coelho. Subsequently he sent
many things to the captain-major. All this happened at
the time when he took us for Turks or for Moors from
some foreign land, for in case we came from Turkey he
begged to be shown the bows of our country and our books
of the Law. But when they learnt that we were Christians
they arranged to seize and kill us by treachery. The pilot,
whom we took with us, subsequently revealed to us all
they intended to do, if they were able.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>False Start and Return to Moçambique.</i>]</p>

<p>On Sunday [March 11] we celebrated mass beneath a
tall tree on the island [of S. Jorge]. We returned on
board and at once set sail, taking with us many fowls,
goats and pigeons, which had been given us in exchange
for small glass-beads.</p>

<p>On Tuesday [March 13] we saw high mountains rising
on the other side of a cape. The coast near the cape was
sparsely covered with trees, resembling elms. We were
at that time over twenty leagues from our starting-place,
and there we remained becalmed during Tuesday and
Wednesday. During the following night we stood off
shore with a light easterly wind, and in the morning
[March 15] found ourselves four leagues abaft Moçambique,
but we went again forward on that day until the evening,
when we anchored once more close to the island [of S.
Jorge] on which mass had been celebrated the preceding
Sunday, and there we remained eight days waiting for a
favourable wind.</p>

<p>During our stay here the King of Moçambique sent word
that he wanted to make peace with us and to be our friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
His ambassador was a white Moor and sharif,<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> that is
priest, and at the same time a great drunkard.</p>

<p>Whilst at this place a Moor with his little son came on
board one of our ships, and asked to be allowed to accompany
us, as he was from near Mecca, and had come to
Moçambique as pilot of a vessel from that country.</p>

<p>As the weather did not favour us it became necessary
once more to enter the port of Moçambique, in order to
procure the water of which we stood in need, for the watering
place is on the mainland. This water is drunk by the
inhabitants of the island, for all the water they have there
is brackish.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<p>On Thursday [March 22] we entered the port, and when
it grew dark we lowered our boats. At midnight the
captain-major and Nicolau Coelho, accompanied by some
of us, started in search of water. We took with us the
Moorish pilot, whose object appeared to be to make his
escape, rather than to guide us to a watering-place. As a
matter of fact he either would not or could not find a
watering-place, although we continued our search until
morning. We then withdrew to our ships.</p>

<p>In the evening [March 23] we returned to the main
land, attended by the same pilot. On approaching the
watering-place we saw about twenty men on the beach.
They were armed with assegais, and forbade our approach.
The captain-major upon this ordered three bombards to
be fired upon them, so that we might land. Having
effected our landing, these men fled into the bush, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>took as much water as we wanted. When the sun was
about to set we discovered that a negro belonging to João
de Coimbra had effected his escape.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, the 24th of March, being the eve
of Lady Day, a Moor came abreast our ships, and
[sneeringly] told us that if we wanted water we might go
in search of it, giving us to understand that we should
meet with something which would make us turn back.
The captain-major no sooner heard this [threat] than he
resolved to go, in order to show that we were able to do
them harm if we desired it. We forthwith armed our
boats, placing bombards in their poops, and started for the
village [town]. The Moors had constructed palisades by
lashing planks together, so that those behind them could
not be seen. They were at the time walking along the beach,
armed with assegais, swords,<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> bows, and slings, with which
they hurled stones at us. But our bombards soon made it
so hot for them that they fled behind their palisades; but
this turned out to their injury rather than their profit.
During the three hours that we were occupied in this
manner [bombarding the town] we saw two men killed,
one on the beach and the other behind the palisades.
When we were weary of this work we retired to our
ships to dine. They at once began to fly, carrying
their chattels in <i>almadias</i> to a village on the mainland.</p>

<p>After dinner we started in our boats, in the hope of
being able to make a few prisoners, whom we might
exchange for the two Indian Christians whom they held
captive and the negro who had deserted. With this object
in view we chased an <i>almadia</i>, which belonged to the
sharif and was laden with his chattels, and another in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>which were four negroes.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> The latter was captured by
Paulo da Gama, whilst the one laden with chattels was
abandoned by the crew as soon as they reached the land.
We took still another <i>almadia</i> which had likewise been
abandoned. The negroes we took on board our ships.
In the <i>almadias</i> we found fine cotton-stuffs, baskets
made of palm-fronds, a glazed jar containing butter, glass
phials with scented water, books of the Law, a box containing
skeins of cotton, a cotton net, and many small
baskets filled with millet. All these things, with the
exception of the books, which were kept back to be shown
to the king, were given by the captain-major to the sailors
who were with him and with the other captains.</p>

<p>On Sunday [March 25] we took in water, and on Monday
we proceeded in our armed boats to the village, when
the inhabitants spoke to us from their houses, they daring
no longer to venture on the beach. Having discharged a
few bombards at them we rejoined our ships.</p>

<p>On Tuesday [March 27] we left the town and anchored
close to the islets of São Jorge,<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> where we remained for
three days, in the hope that God would grant us a favourable
wind.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Moçambique to Mombaça</i>].</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 29th of March, we left these islets of
S. Jorge, and as the wind was light, we only covered
twenty-eight leagues up to the morning of Saturday, the
31st of the month.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<p>In the morning of that day we were once more abreast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>of the land of the Moors, from which powerful currents had
previously carried us.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>On Sunday, April 1, we came to some islands close to
the mainland. The first of these we called <i>Ilha do Açoutado</i>
(“Island of the flogged-one”), because of the flogging
inflicted upon our Moorish pilot, who had lied to the
captain on Saturday night, by stating that these islands
were the mainland. Native craft take their course between
these islands and the mainland, where the water is four
fathoms deep, but we kept outside of them. These islands
are numerous, and we were unable to distinguish one from
the other; they are inhabited.</p>

<p>On Monday [April 2] we sighted other islands five
leagues off the shore.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 4th of April, we made sail to the
N.W., and before noon we sighted an extensive country,
and two islands close to it, surrounded with shoals. And
when we were near enough for the pilots to recognise
these islands, they told us that we had left three leagues
behind us an island<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> inhabited by Christians. We man&oelig;uvred
all day in the hope of fetching this island, but in vain,
for the wind was too strong for us. After this we thought it
best to bear away for a city called Mombaça, reported to
be four days ahead of us.</p>

<p>The above island was one of those which we had come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>to discover, for our pilots said that it was inhabited by
Christians.</p>

<p>When we bore away for the north it was already late,
and the wind was high. At nightfall we perceived a large
island, which remained to the north of us.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> Our pilot told
us that there were two towns on this island, one of
Christians and the other of Moors.</p>

<p>That night we stood out to sea, and in the morning
[April 5] we no longer saw the land. We then steered to
the N.W., and in the evening we again beheld the land.
During the following night we bore away to the N. by W.,
and during the morning-watch we changed our course to
the N.N.W. Sailing thus before a favourable wind, the
<i>S. Raphael</i>, two hours before break of day [April 6], ran
aground on a shoal, about two leagues from the land.
Immediately the <i>Raphael</i> touched bottom, the vessels
following her were warned by shouts, and these were no
sooner heard than they cast anchor about the distance of a
gunshot from the stranded vessel, and lowered their boats.
When the tide fell the <i>Raphael</i> lay high and dry. With
the help of the boats many anchors were laid out, and when
the tide rose again, in the course of the day, the vessel
floated and there was much rejoicing.</p>

<p>On the mainland, facing these shoals, there rises a lofty
range of mountains, beautiful of aspect. These mountains
we called <i>Serras de São Raphael</i>, and we gave the same
name to the shoals.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst the vessel was high and dry, two <i>Almadias</i>
approached us. One was laden with fine oranges, better
than those of Portugal. Two of the Moors remained on
board, and accompanied us next day to Mombaça.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, the 7th of the month, and eve of
Palm Sunday, we ran along the coast and saw some islands
at a distance of fifteen leagues from the mainland, and
about six leagues in extent. They supply the vessels
of the country with masts. All are inhabited by Moors.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Mombaça</i>].</p>

<p>On Saturday [April 7] we cast anchor off Mombaça,
but did not enter the port. No sooner had we been perceived
than a <i>zavra</i><a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> manned by Moors came out to us:
in front of the city there lay numerous vessels all dressed
in flags.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> And we, anxious not to be outdone, also dressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>our ships, and we actually surpassed their show, for we
wanted in nothing but men, even the few whom we had
being very ill. We anchored here with much pleasure, for
we confidently hoped that on the following day we might
go on land and hear mass jointly with the Christians
reported to live there under their own <i>alcaide</i><a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> in a quarter
separate from that of the Moors.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center f085">Native Craft in the Harbour of Mombasa.<br />
(<i>From a photograph by the late Capt. Foot, R.N.</i>)</p></div>

<p>The pilots who had come with us told us there resided
both Moors and Christians in this city; that these latter
lived apart under their own lords, and that on our arrival
they would receive us with much honour and take us to
their houses. But they said this for a purpose of their own,
for it was not true. At midnight there approached us a
<i>zavra</i> with about a hundred men, all armed with cutlasses
(tarçados) and bucklers. When they came to the vessel
of the captain-major they attempted to board her, armed
as they were, but this was not permitted, only four or five
of the most distinguished men among them being allowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>on board. They remained about a couple of hours, and it
seemed to us that they paid us this visit merely to find out
whether they might not capture one or the other of our
vessels.</p>

<p>On Palm Sunday [April 8] the King of Mombaça sent
the captain-major a sheep and large quantities of oranges,
lemons and sugar-cane, together with a ring, as a pledge
of safety, letting him know that in case of his entering the
port he would be supplied with all he stood in need of.
This present was conveyed to us by two men, almost white,
who said they were Christians, which appeared to be the
fact. The captain-major sent the king a string of coral-beads
as a return present, and let him know that he purposed
entering the port on the following day. On the
same day the captain-major’s vessel was visited by four
Moors of distinction.</p>

<p>Two men were sent by the captain-major to the king,
still further to confirm these peaceful assurances. When
these landed they were followed by a crowd as far as the
gates of the palace. Before reaching the king they passed
through four doors, each guarded by a doorkeeper with
a drawn cutlass. The king received them hospitably, and
ordered that they should be shown over the city. They
stopped on their way at the house of two Christian merchants,
who showed them a paper (carta), an object of
their adoration, on which was a sketch of the Holy Ghost.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>
When they had seen all, the king sent them back with
samples of cloves, pepper and corn,<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> with which articles he
would allow us to load our ships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>On Tuesday [April 10], when weighing anchor to enter
the port, the captain-major’s vessel would not pay off, and
struck the vessel which followed astern. We therefore
again cast anchor. When the Moors who were in our
ship saw that we did not go on, they scrambled into a
<i>zavra</i> attached to our stern; whilst the two pilots whom
we had brought from Moçambique jumped into the water,
and were picked up by the men in the <i>zavra</i>. At night
the captain-major “questioned” two Moors [from Moçambique]<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>
whom we had on board, by dropping boiling oil
upon their skin, so that they might confess any treachery
intended against us. They said that orders had been given
to capture us as soon as we entered the port, and thus to
avenge what we had done at Moçambique. And when
this torture was being applied a second time, one of the
Moors, although his hands were tied, threw himself into the
sea, whilst the other did so during the morning watch.</p>

<p>About midnight two <i>almadias</i>, with many men in them,
approached. The <i>almadias</i> stood off whilst the men
entered the water, some swimming in the direction of the
<i>Berrio</i>, others in that of the <i>Raphael</i>. Those who swam
to the <i>Berrio</i> began to cut the cable. The men on watch
thought at first that they were tunny fish, but when they
perceived their mistake they shouted to the other vessels.
The other swimmers had already got hold of the rigging
of the mizzen-mast. Seeing themselves discovered, they
silently slipped down and fled. These and other wicked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>tricks were practised upon us by these dogs, but our Lord
did not allow them to succeed, because they were unbelievers.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Mombaça is a large city seated upon an eminence
washed by the sea. Its port is entered daily by
numerous vessels. At its entrance stands a pillar, and by
the sea a low-lying fortress.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> Those who had gone on
shore told us that in the town they had seen many men
in irons; and it seemed to us that these must be Christians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>as the Christians in that country are at war with the
Moors.</p>

<p>The Christian merchants in the town are only temporary
residents, and are held in much subjection, they not being
allowed to do anything except by the order of the Moorish
King.</p>

<p>It pleased God in his mercy that on arriving at this
city all our sick recovered their health, for the climate
(“air”) of this place is very good.</p>

<p>After the malice and treachery planned by these dogs
had been discovered, we still remained on Wednesday and
Thursday [April 11 and 12].<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Mombaça to Malindi.</i>]</p>

<p>We left in the morning [April 13], the wind being light, and
anchored about eight leagues from Mombaça, close to the
shore. At break of day [April 14] we saw two boats (<i>barcas</i>)
about three leagues to the leeward, in the open sea, and at
once gave chase, with the intention of capturing them, for
we wanted to secure a pilot who would guide us to where
we wanted to go. At vesper-time we came up with one of
them, and captured it, the other escaping towards the land.
In the one we took we found seventeen men, besides gold,
silver, and an abundance of maize and other provisions; as
also a young woman, who was the wife of an old Moor of
distinction, who was a passenger. When we came up with
the boat they all threw themselves into the water, but we
picked them up from our boats.</p>

<p>That same day [April 14] at sunset, we cast anchor off a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>place called Milinde (Malindi),<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> which is thirty leagues
from Mombaça. The following places are between
Mombaça and Milinde, viz., Benapa, Toça and Nuguoquioniete.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Malindi.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>On Easter Sunday [April 15] the Moors whom we had
taken in the boat told us that there were at this city of
Melinde four vessels belonging to Christians from India,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>
and that if it pleased us to take them there, they would
provide us, instead of them, Christian pilots and all we
stood in need of, including water, wood and other things.
The captain-major much desired to have pilots from the
country, and having discussed the matter with his Moorish
prisoners, he cast anchor off the town, at a distance of about
half a league from the mainland. The inhabitants of the
town did not venture to come aboard our ships, for they
had already learnt that we had captured a vessel and made
her occupants prisoners.</p>

<p>On Monday morning [April 16] the captain-major had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>the old Moor taken to a sandbank in front of the town,
where he was picked up by an <i>almadia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> The Moor
explained to the king the wishes of the captain-major,
and how much he desired to make peace with him. After
dinner the Moor came back in a <i>zavra</i>, accompanied by
one of the king’s cavaliers and a sharif: he also brought
three sheep. These messengers told the captain-general
that the king would rejoice to make peace with him, and
to enter into friendly relations; that he would willingly
grant to the captain-major all his country afforded,
whether pilots or anything else. The captain-major
upon this sent word that he proposed to enter the port on
the following day, and forwarded by the king’s messengers
a present consisting of a <i>balandrau</i>,<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> two strings of coral,
three wash-hand basins, a hat, little bells and two pieces
of <i>lambel</i>.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p>Consequently, on Tuesday [April 17] we approached
nearer to the town. The king sent the captain-major six
sheep, besides quantities of cloves, cumin, ginger, nutmeg
and pepper, as also a message, telling him that if he desired
to have an interview with him he (the king) would come
out in his <i>zavra</i>, when the captain-major could meet him
in a boat.</p>

<p>On Wednesday [April 18], after dinner, when the king
came up close to the ships in a <i>zavra</i>, the captain-major
at once entered one of his boats, which had been well
furnished, and many friendly words were exchanged when
they lay side by side. The king having invited the
captain-major to come to his house to rest, after which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>(the king) would visit him on board his ship, the captain-major
said that he was not permitted by his master to go on
land, and if he were to do so a bad report would be given
of him. The king wanted to know what would be said of
himself by his people if he were to visit the ships, and what
account could he render them? He then asked for the
name of our king, which was written down for him, and
said that on our return he would send an ambassador with
us, or a letter.</p>

<p>When both had said all they desired, the captain-major
sent for the Moors whom he had taken prisoner, and
surrendered them all. This gave much satisfaction to the
king, who said that he valued this act more highly than if
he had been presented with a town. And the king, much
pleased, made the circuit of our ships, the bombards of
which fired a salute. About three hours were spent in
this way. When the king went away he left in the ship
one of his sons and a sharif, and took two of us away
with him, to whom he desired to show his palace. He,
moreover, told the captain that as he would not go ashore
he would himself return on the following day to the
beach, and would order his horsemen to go through some
exercises.</p>

<p>The king wore a robe (royal cloak) of damask trimmed
with green satin, and a rich <i>touca</i>. He was seated on two
cushioned chairs of bronze, beneath a round sunshade of
crimson satin attached to a pole. An old man, who
attended him as page, carried a short sword in a silver
sheath. There were many players on <i>anafils</i>, and two
trumpets of ivory,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> richly carved, and of the size of a man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>which were blown from a hole in the side, and made sweet
harmony with the <i>anafils</i>.</p>

<p class="caption">A Siwa Blower.<br />(<i>From a photograph by Sir John Kirk.</i>)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>
<p>On Thursday [April 19] the captain-major and Nicolau
Coelho rowed along the front of the town, bombards having
been placed in the poops of their long-boats. Many people
were along the shore, and among them two horsemen, who
appeared to take much delight in a sham-fight. The king
was carried in a palanquin from the stone steps of his
palace to the side of the captain-major’s boats. He again
begged the captain to come ashore, as he had a helpless
father who wanted to see him, and that he and his sons
would go on board the ships as hostages. The captain,
however, excused himself.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>We found here four vessels belonging to Indian Christians.
When they came for the first time on board Paulo da
Gama’s ship, the captain-major being there at the time,
they were shown an altar-piece representing Our Lady at
the foot of the cross, with Jesus Christ in her arms and the
apostles around her. When the Indians saw this picture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>they prostrated themselves, and as long as we were there
they came to say their prayers in front of it, bringing
offerings of cloves, pepper, and other things.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p>These Indians are tawny men; they wear but little
clothing and have long beards and long hair, which they
braid. They told us that they ate no beef. Their language
differs from that of the Arabs, but some of them know a
little of it, as they hold much intercourse with them.</p>

<p>On the day on which the captain-major went up to the
town in the boats, these Christian Indians fired off many
bombards from their vessels, and when they saw him pass
they raised their hands and shouted lustily <i>Christ! Christ!</i><a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>That same night they asked the king’s permission to
give us a night-fête. And when night came they fired off
many bombards, sent up rockets, and raised loud shouts.</p>

<p>These Indians warned the captain-major against going
on shore, and told him not to trust to their “fanfares”, as
they neither came from their hearts nor from their good
will.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday, the 22nd of April, the king’s
<i>zavra</i> brought on board one of his confidential servants,
and as two days had passed without any visitors, the
captain-major had this man seized, and sent word to the
king that he required the pilots whom he had promised.
The king, when he received this message, sent a Christian
pilot,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> and the captain-major allowed the gentleman, whom
he had retained in his vessel, to go away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>We were much pleased with the Christian pilot whom
the king had sent us. We learnt from him that the island
of which we heard at Moçambique as being inhabited by
Christians was in reality an island subject to this same
King of Moçambique; that half of it belonged to the
Moors and the other half to the Christians; that many
pearls were to be found there, and that it was called
Quyluee.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> This is the island the Moorish pilots wanted to
take us to, and we also wished to go there, for we believed
that what they said was true.</p>

<p>The town of Malindi lies in a bay and extends along
the shore. It may be likened to Alcouchette.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> Its houses
are lofty and well white-washed, and have many windows;
on the landside are palm-groves, and all around it maize
and vegetables are being cultivated.</p>

<p>We remained in front of this town during nine days,<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a>
and all this time we had fêtes, sham-fights, and musical
performances (“fanfares”).</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Across the Gulf&mdash;the Arabian Sea.</i>]</p>

<p>We left Malindi on Tuesday, the 24th of the month [of
April] for a city called Qualecut [Calecut], with the pilot
whom the king had given us. The coast there runs north
and south, and the land encloses a huge bay with a strait.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>In this bay,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> we were told, were to be found many large
cities of Christians and Moors, including one called Quambay
[Cambay], as also six-hundred known islands, and
within it the Red Sea and the “house” [Kaabah] of Mecca.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday [April 29] we once more saw
the North Star, which we had not seen for a long time.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 18th of May,<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> after having seen no land
for twenty-three days,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> we sighted lofty mountains, and
having all this time sailed before the wind we could not
have made less than 600 leagues. The land, when first
sighted,<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> was at a distance of eight leagues, and our lead
reached bottom at forty-five fathoms. That same night
we took a course to the S.S.W., so as to get away from the
coast. On the following day [May 19] we again approached
the land, but owing to the heavy rain and a thunderstorm,<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>
which prevailed whilst we were sailing along the coast, our
pilot was unable to identify the exact locality. On Sunday
[May 20] we found ourselves close to some mountains,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>
and when we were near enough for the pilot to recognise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>them he told us that they were above Calecut, and that
this was the country we desired to go to.</p>

<h3>[<i>Calecut.</i>]</h3>

<p>[<i>Arrival.</i>] That night [May 20] we anchored two
leagues from the city of Calecut, and we did so because
our pilot mistook <i>Capua</i>,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> a town at that place, for
Calecut. Still further<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> there is another town called
<i>Pandarani</i>.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> We anchored about a league and a half
from the shore. After we were at anchor, four boats
(<i>almadias</i>) approached us from the land, who asked of
what nation we were. We told them, and they then
pointed out Calecut to us.</p>

<p>On the following day [May 21] these same boats came
again alongside, when the captain-major sent one of the
convicts<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> to Calecut, and those with whom he went took
him to two Moors from Tunis, who could speak Castilian
and Genoese.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> The first greeting that he received was in
these words: “May the Devil take thee! What brought
you hither?” They asked what he sought so far away
from home, and he told them that we came in search of
Christians and of spices. They said: “Why does not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>King of Castile, the King of France, or the Signoria of
Venice send hither?” He said that the King of Portugal
would not consent to their doing so, and they said he did
the right thing. After this conversation they took him to
their lodgings and gave him wheaten bread and honey.
When he had eaten he returned to the ships, accompanied
by one of the Moors, who was, no sooner on board, than he
said these words: “A lucky venture, a lucky venture!
Plenty of rubies, plenty of emeralds! You owe great
thanks to God, for having brought you to a country holding
such riches!” We were greatly astonished to hear his
talk, for we never expected to hear our language spoken
so far away from Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<p>[<i>A description of Calecut.</i>] The city of Calecut is inhabited
by Christians. They are of a tawny complexion.
Some of them have big beards and long hair, whilst others
clip their hair short or shave the head, merely allowing a
tuft to remain on the crown as a sign that they are
Christians. They also wear moustaches. They pierce the
ears and wear much gold in them. They go naked down
to the waist, covering their lower extremities with very
fine cotton stuffs. But it is only the most respectable who
do this, for the others manage as best they are able.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>The women of this country, as a rule, are ugly and of
small stature. They wear many jewels of gold round the
neck, numerous bracelets on their arms, and rings set with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>precious stones on their toes. All these people are well-disposed
and apparently of mild temper. At first sight
they seem covetous and ignorant.</p>

<p>[<i>A messenger sent to the King</i>]. When we arrived at
Calecut the king was fifteen leagues away.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> The captain-major
sent two men<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> to him with a message, informing
him that an ambassador had arrived from the King of
Portugal with letters, and that if he desired it he would
take them to where the king then was.</p>

<p>The king presented the bearers of this message with
much fine cloth. He sent word to the captain bidding him
welcome, saying that he was about to proceed to Qualecut
(Calecut). As a matter of fact, he started at once with a
large retinue.</p>

<p>[<i>At Anchor at Pandarani</i>, May 27]. A pilot accompanied
our two men, with orders to take us to a place called
Pandarani, below the place [Capua] where we anchored at
first. At this time we were actually in front of the city of
Calecut. We were told that the anchorage at the place to
which we were to go was good, whilst at the place we were
then it was bad, with a stony bottom, which was quite
true;<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> and, moreover, that it was customary for the ships
which came to this country to anchor there for the sake of
safety. We ourselves did not feel comfortable, and the
captain-major had no sooner received this royal message
than he ordered the sails to be set, and we departed.
We did not, however, anchor as near the shore as the
king’s pilot desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>When we were at anchor, a message arrived informing
the captain-major that the king was already in the city.
At the same time the king sent a <i>bale</i>,<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> with other men of
distinction, to Pandarani, to conduct the captain-major to
where the king awaited him. This <i>bale</i> is like an <i>alcaide</i>,
and is always attended by two hundred men armed with
swords and bucklers. As it was late when this message
arrived, the captain-major deferred going.</p>

<p>[<i>Gama goes to Calecut.</i>] On the following morning,
which was Monday, May 28th, the captain-major set out
to speak to the king, and took with him thirteen men, of
whom I was one.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> We put on our best attire, placed
bombards in our boats, and took with us trumpets and
many flags. On landing, the captain-major was received
by the <i>alcaide</i>, with whom were many men, armed and
unarmed. The reception was friendly, as if the people
were pleased to see us, though at first appearances looked
threatening, for they carried naked swords in their hands.
A palanquin was provided for the captain-major, such as
is used by men of distinction in that country, as also by
some of the merchants, who pay something to the king for
this privilege. The captain-major entered the palanquin,
which was carried by six men by turns. Attended by all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>these people we took the road of Qualecut, and came first
to another town, called Capua. The captain-major was
there deposited at the house of a man of rank, whilst we
others were provided with food, consisting of rice, with
much butter, and excellent boiled fish. The captain-major
did not wish to eat, and when we had done so, we embarked
on a river close by, which flows between the sea and the
mainland, close to the coast.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> The two boats in which
we embarked were lashed together,<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> so that we were not
separated. There were numerous other boats, all crowded
with people. As to those who were on the banks I say
nothing; their number was infinite, and they had all come
to see us. We went up that river for about a league, and
saw many large ships drawn up high and dry on its banks,
for there is no port here.</p>

<p>When we disembarked, the captain-major once more
entered his palanquin. The road was crowded with a
countless multitude anxious to see us. Even the women
came out of their houses with children in their arms and
followed us.</p>

<p>[<i>Christian Church.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> When we arrived [at Calecut]
they took us to a large church, and this is what we saw:&mdash;</p>

<p>The body of the church is as large as a monastery, all
built of hewn stone and covered with tiles. At the main
entrance rises a pillar of bronze as high as a mast, on the
top of which was perched a bird, apparently a cock. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>addition to this, there was another pillar as high as a man,
and very stout. In the centre of the body of the church
rose a chapel,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> all built of hewn stone, with a bronze door
sufficiently wide for a man to pass, and stone steps leading
up to it. Within this sanctuary stood a small image which
they said represented Our Lady.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> Along the walls, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>the main entrance, hung seven small bells.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> In this
church the captain-major said his prayers, and we with
him.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p>We did not go within the chapel, for it is the custom that
only certain servants of the church, called <i>quafees</i>,<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> should
enter. These <i>quafees</i> wore some threads passing over the
left shoulder and under the right arm, in the same manner
as our deacons wear the stole. They threw holy water
over us, and gave us some white earth,<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> which the
Christians of this country are in the habit of putting on
their foreheads, breasts, around the neck, and on the
forearms. They threw holy water upon the captain-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>major
and gave him some of the earth, which he gave in
charge of someone, giving them to understand that he
would put it on later.</p>

<p>Many other saints were painted on the walls of the
church, wearing crowns. They were painted variously,
with teeth protruding an inch from the mouth, and four or
five arms.</p>

<p>Below this church there was a large masonry tank,
similar to many others which we had seen along the road.</p>

<p>[<i>Progress through the Town.</i>] After we had left that
place, and had arrived at the entrance to the city [of
Calecut] we were shown another church, where we saw
things like those described above. Here the crowd grew
so dense that progress along the street became next to
impossible, and for this reason they put the captain into a
house, and us with him.</p>

<p>The king sent a brother of the <i>bale</i>, who was a lord of
this country, to accompany the captain, and he was
attended by men beating drums, blowing <i>anafils</i> and bagpipes,
and firing off matchlocks. In conducting the captain
they showed us much respect, more than is shown in Spain
to a king. The number of people was countless, for in
addition to those who surrounded us, and among whom
there were two thousand armed men, they crowded the
roofs and houses.</p>

<p>[<i>The King’s Palace.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> The further we advanced in the
direction of the king’s palace, the more did they increase
in number. And when we arrived there, men of much
distinction and great lords came out to meet the captain,
and joined those who were already in attendance upon him.
It was then an hour before sunset. When we reached the
palace we passed through a gate into a courtyard of great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>size, and before we arrived at where the king was, we passed
four doors, through which we had to force our way, giving
many blows to the people. When, at last, we reached the
door where the king was, there came forth from it a little
old man, who holds a position resembling that of a bishop,
and whose advice the king acts upon in all affairs of the
church. This man embraced the captain when he entered
the door. Several men were wounded at this door,<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> and
we only got in by the use of much force.</p>

<p>[<i>A Royal Audience, May 28.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> The king was in a small
court, reclining upon a couch covered with a cloth of green
velvet, above which was a good mattress, and upon this
again a sheet of cotton stuff, very white and fine, more so
than any linen. The cushions were after the same fashion.
In his left hand the king held a very large golden cup
[spittoon], having a capacity of half an almude [8 pints].
At its mouth this cup was two palmas [16 inches] wide,
and apparently it was massive. Into this cup the king
threw the husks of a certain herb which is chewed by the
people of this country because of its soothing effects, and
which they call <i>atambor</i>.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> On the right side of the king
stood a basin of gold, so large that a man might just
encircle it with his arms: this contained the herbs. There
were likewise many silver jugs. The canopy above the
couch was all gilt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>The captain, on entering, saluted in the manner of the
country: by putting the hands together, then raising them
towards Heaven, as is done by Christians when addressing
God, and immediately afterwards opening them and shutting
the fists quickly. The king beckoned to the captain
with his right hand to come nearer, but the captain did
not approach him, for it is the custom of the country for
no man to approach the king except only the servant who
hands him the herbs, and when anyone addresses the king
he holds his hand before the mouth, and remains at a
distance. When the king beckoned to the captain he
looked at us others, and ordered us to be seated on a stone
bench near him, where he could see us. He ordered that
water for our hands should be given us, as also some fruit,
one kind of which resembled a melon, except that its outside
was rough and the inside sweet, whilst another kind of
fruit resembled a fig, and tasted very nice.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> There were
men who prepared these fruits for us; and the king looked
at us eating, and smiled; and talked to the servant who
stood near him supplying him with the herbs referred to.</p>

<p>Then, throwing his eyes on the captain, who sat facing
him, he invited him to address himself to the courtiers
present, saying they were men of much distinction, that he
could tell them whatever he desired to say, and they would
repeat it to him (the king). The captain-major replied
that he was the ambassador of the King of Portugal, and
the bearer of a message which he could only deliver to
him personally. The king said this was good, and
immediately asked him to be conducted to a chamber.
When the captain-major had entered, the king, too, rose
and joined him, whilst we remained where we were.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>this happened about sunset. An old man who was in the
court took away the couch as soon as the king rose, but
allowed the plate to remain. The king, when he joined
the captain, threw himself upon another couch, covered
with various stuffs embroidered in gold, and asked the
captain what he wanted.</p>

<p>And the captain told him he was the ambassador of a
King of Portugal, who was Lord of many countries and the
possessor of great wealth of every description, exceeding
that of any king of these parts; that for a period of sixty
years his ancestors had annually sent out vessels to make
discoveries in the direction of India, as they knew that
there were Christian kings there like themselves. This, he
said, was the reason which induced them to order this
country to be discovered, not because they sought for gold
or silver, for of this they had such abundance that they
needed not what was to be found in this country. He further
stated that the captains sent out travelled for a year or two,
until their provisions were exhausted, and then returned to
Portugal, without having succeeded in making the desired
discovery. There reigned a king now whose name was
Dom Manuel, who had ordered him to build three vessels,
of which he had been appointed captain-major, and who
had ordered him not to return to Portugal until he should
have discovered this King of the Christians, on pain of
having his head cut off. That two letters<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>intrusted to him to be presented in case he succeeded in
discovering him, and that he would do so on the ensuing
day; and, finally, he had been instructed to say by word
of mouth that he [the King of Portugal] desired to be his
friend and brother.</p>

<p>In reply to this the king said that he was welcome;
that, on his part, he held him as a friend and brother, and
would send ambassadors with him to Portugal. This
latter had been asked as a favour, the captain pretending
that he would not dare to present himself before his king
and master unless he was able to present, at the same time,
some men of this country.</p>

<p>These and many other things passed between the two in
this chamber, and as it was already late in the night, the
king asked the captain with whom he desired to lodge,
with Christians or with Moors? And the captain replied,
neither with Christians nor with Moors, and begged as a
favour that he be given a lodging by himself. The king
said he would order it thus, upon which the captain took
leave of the king and came to where we were, that is, to a
veranda lit up by a huge candlestick. By that time four
hours of the night had already gone.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<p>[<i>A Night’s Lodging.</i>] We then all went forth with the
captain in search of our lodgings, and a countless crowd
with us. And the rain poured down so heavily that the
streets ran with water. The captain went on the back of
six men [in a palanquin], and the time occupied in passing
through the city was so long that the captain at last grew
tired, and complained to the king’s factor, a Moor of distinction,
who attended him to the lodgings. The Moor
then took him to his own house,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> and we were admitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>to a court within it, where there was a veranda roofed in
with tiles. Many carpets had been spread, and there were
two large candlesticks like those at the Royal palace. At
the top of each of these were great iron lamps, fed with oil
or butter, and each lamp had four wicks, which gave much
light. These lamps they use instead of torches.</p>

<p>This same Moor then had a horse brought for the captain
to take him to his lodgings, but it was without a saddle,
and the captain refused to mount it.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> We then started for
our lodgings, and when we arrived we found there some of
our men [who had come from the ships] with the captain’s
bed, and with numerous other things which the captain had
brought as presents for the king.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p>[<i>Presents for the King.</i>] On Tuesday [May 29] the
captain got ready the following things to be sent to the
king, viz., twelve pieces of <i>lambel</i>,<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> four scarlet hoods, six
hats, four strings of coral, a case containing six wash-hand
basins, a case of sugar, two casks of oil, and two of honey.
And as it is the custom not to send anything to the king
without the knowledge of the Moor, his factor, and of the
<i>bale</i>, the captain informed them of his intention. They
came, and when they saw the present they laughed at it,
saying that it was not a thing to offer to a king, that the
poorest merchant from Mecca, or any other part of India,
gave more, and that if he wanted to make a present it should
be in gold, as the king would not accept such things. When
the captain heard this he grew sad, and said that he had
brought no gold, that, moreover, he was no merchant, but
an ambassador; that he gave of that which he had, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>was his own [private gift] and not the king’s;<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> that if the
King of Portugal ordered him to return he would intrust
him with far richer presents; and that if King Camolim<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a>
would not accept these things he would send them back to
the ships. Upon this they declared that they would not
forward his presents, nor consent to his forwarding them
himself. When they had gone there came certain Moorish
merchants, and they all depreciated the present which the
captain desired to be sent to the king.</p>

<p>When the captain saw that they were determined not to
forward his present, he said, that as they would not allow
him to send his present to the palace he would go to speak
to the king, and would then return to the ships. They
approved of this, and told him that if he would wait a short
time they would return and accompany him to the palace.
And the captain waited all day, but they never came back.
The captain was very wroth at being among so phlegmatic
and unreliable a people, and intended, at first, to go
to the palace without them. On further consideration,
however, he thought it best to wait until the following day.
As to us others, we diverted ourselves, singing and dancing
to the sound of trumpets, and enjoyed ourselves much.</p>

<p>[<i>A Second Audience, May 30.</i>] On Wednesday morning
the Moors returned, and took the captain to the palace, and
us others with him. The palace was crowded with armed
men. Our captain was kept waiting with his conductors
for fully four long hours, outside a door, which was only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>opened when the king sent word to admit him, attended
by two men only, whom he might select. The captain
said that he desired to have Fernão Martins with him,
who could interpret, and his secretary.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> It seemed to
him, as it did to us, that this separation portended no
good.</p>

<p>When he had entered, the king said that he had expected
him on Tuesday. The captain said that the long road had
tired him, and that for this reason he had not come to see
him. The king then said that he had told him that he
came from a very rich kingdom, and yet had brought him
nothing; that he had also told him that he was the bearer
of a letter, which had not yet been delivered. To this the
captain rejoined that he had brought nothing, because the
object of his voyage was merely to make discoveries, but
that when other ships came he would then see what they
brought him; as to the letter, it was true that he had
brought one, and would deliver it immediately.</p>

<p>The king then asked what it was he had come to discover:
stones or men? If he came to discover men, as he
said, why had he brought nothing? Moreover, he had
been told that he carried with him the golden image of a
Santa Maria. The captain said that the Santa Maria was
not of gold, and that even if she were he would not part with
her, as she had guided him across the ocean, and would
guide him back to his own country. The king then asked
for the letter. The captain said that he begged as a favour,
that as the Moors wished him ill and might misinterpret
him, a Christian able to speak Arabic should be sent for.
The king said this was well, and at once sent for a young
man, of small stature, whose name was Quaram. The
captain then said that he had two letters, one written in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>his own language and the other in that of the Moors; that
he was able to read the former, and knew that it contained
nothing but what would prove acceptable; but that as to
the other he was unable to read it, and it might be good,
or contain something that was erroneous. As the Christian
was unable to <i>read</i> Moorish, four Moors took the letter and
read it between them, after which they translated it to the
king, who was well satisfied with its contents.</p>

<p>The king then asked what kind of merchandise was to
be found in his country. The captain said there was much
corn, cloth, iron, bronze, and many other things. The
king asked whether he had any merchandise with him.
The captain replied that he had a little of each sort, as
samples, and that if permitted to return to the ships he
would order it to be landed, and that meantime four or
five men would remain at the lodgings assigned them.
The king said no! He might take all his people with him,
securely moor his ships, land his merchandise, and sell it to
the best advantage. Having taken leave of the king the
captain returned to his lodgings, and we with him. As it
was already late no attempt was made to depart that night.</p>

<p>[<i>Return to Pandarani, May 31.</i>] On Thursday morning
a horse without a saddle was brought to the captain, who
declined to mount it, asking that a horse of the country,
that is a palanquin, might be provided, as he could not ride
a horse without a saddle. He was then taken to the house
of a wealthy merchant of the name of Guzerate,<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> who
ordered a palanquin to be got ready. On its arrival the
captain started at once for Pandarani, where our ships were,
many people following him. We others, not being able to
keep up with him, were left behind. Trudging thus along
we were overtaken by the <i>bale</i>, who passed on to join the
captain. We lost our way, and wandered far inland, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>the <i>bale</i> sent a man after us, who put us on the right road.
When we reached Pandarani we found the captain inside a
rest-house, of which there were many along the road, so
that travellers and wayfarers might find protection against
the rain.</p>

<p>[<i>Detention at Pandarani, May 31 to June 2.</i>] The <i>bale</i>
and many others were with the captain. On our arrival
the captain asked the <i>bale</i> for an <i>almadia</i>, so that we might
go to our ships; but the <i>bale</i> and the others said that it
was already late&mdash;in fact, the sun had set&mdash;and that he
should go next day. The captain said that unless he provided
an <i>almadia</i> he would return to the king, who had
given orders to take him back to the ships, whilst they tried
to detain him&mdash;a very bad thing, as he was a Christian like
themselves. When they saw the dark looks of the captain
they said he was at liberty to depart at once, and that they
would give him thirty <i>almadias</i> if he needed them. They
then took us along the beach, and as it seemed to the
captain that they harboured some evil design, he sent three
men in advance, with orders that in case they found the
ship’s boats and his brother, to tell him to conceal himself.
They went, and finding nothing, turned back; but as we
had been taken in another direction we did not meet.</p>

<p>They then took us to the house of a Moor&mdash;for it was
already far in the night&mdash;and when we got there they told
us that they would go in search of the three men who had
not yet returned. When they were gone, the captain
ordered fowls and rice to be purchased, and we ate,
notwithstanding our fatigue, having been all day on our
legs.</p>

<p>Those who had gone [in search of the three men] only
returned in the morning, and the captain said that after
all they seemed well disposed towards us, and had acted
with the best intentions when they objected to our departure
the day before. On the other hand we suspected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
them on account of what had happened at Calecut, and
looked upon them as ill-disposed.</p>

<p>When they returned [June 1] the captain again asked
for boats to take him to his ships. They then began to
whisper among themselves, and said that we should have
them if we would order our vessels to come nearer the shore.
The captain said that if he ordered his vessels to approach
his brother would think that he was being held a prisoner,
and that he gave this order on compulsion, and would hoist
the sails and return to Portugal. They said that if we
refused to order the ships to come nearer we should not
be permitted to embark. The captain said that King
Çamolin had sent him back to his ships, and that as they
would not let him go, as ordered by the king, he should
return to the king, who was a Christian like himself. If the
king would not let him go, and wanted him to remain in
his country, he would do so with much pleasure. They
agreed that he should be permitted to go, but afforded him
no opportunity for doing so, for they immediately closed all
the doors, and many armed men entered to guard us, none
of us being allowed to go outside without being accompanied
by several of these guards.</p>

<p>They then asked us to give up our sails and rudders.
The captain declared that he would give up none of these
things: King Çamolin having unconditionally ordered him
to return to his ships, they might do with him whatever
they liked, but he would give up nothing.</p>

<p>The captain and we others felt very down-hearted,
though outwardly we pretended not to notice what they
did. The captain said that as they refused him permission
to go back, they would at least allow his men to do so, as
at the place they were in they would die of hunger. But
they said that we must remain where we were, and that if
we died of hunger we must bear it, as they cared nothing
for that. Whilst thus detained, one of the men whom we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
had missed the night before turned up. He told the captain
that Nicolau Coelho had been awaiting him with the boats
since last night. When the captain heard this he sent a
man away secretly to Nicolau Coelho, because of the guards
by whom we were surrounded, with orders to go back to
the ships and place them in a secure place. Nicolau
Coelho, on receipt of this message, departed forthwith.
But our guards having information of what was going on,
at once launched a large number of <i>almadias</i> and pursued
him for a short distance. When they found that they
could not overtake him they returned to the captain, whom
they asked to write a letter to his brother, requesting him
to bring the ships nearer to the land and further within the
port [roadstead]. The captain said he was quite willing,
but that his brother would not do this; and that even if he
consented those who were with him, not being willing to
die, would not do so. But they asked how this could
be, as they knew well that any order he gave would be
obeyed.</p>

<p>The captain did not wish the ships to come within the
port, for it seemed to him&mdash;as it did to us&mdash;that once inside
they could easily be captured, after which they would first
kill him, and then us others, as we were already in their
power.</p>

<p>We passed all that day most anxiously. At night more
people surrounded us than ever before, and we were no
longer allowed to walk in the compound, within which we
were, but confined within a small tiled court, with a multitude
of people around us. We quite expected that on the
following day we should be separated, or that some harm
would befall us, for we noticed that our gaolers were much
annoyed with us. This, however, did not prevent our
making a good supper off the things found in the village.
Throughout that night we were guarded by over a
hundred men, all armed with swords, two-edged battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>axes,<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>
shields, and bows and arrows. Whilst some of these
slept, others kept guard, each taking his turn of duty
throughout the night.</p>

<p>On the following day, Saturday, June 2, in the morning,
these gentlemen [<i>i.e.</i>, the <i>bale</i> and others] came back, and
this time they “wore better faces.” They told the captain
that as he had informed the king that he intended to land his
merchandise, he should now give orders to have this done,
as it was the custom of the country that every ship on
its arrival should at once land the merchandise it brought,
as also the crews, and that the vendors should not return
on board until the whole of it had been sold. The captain
consented, and said he would write to his brother to see to
its being done. They said this was well, and that immediately
after the arrival of the merchandise he would be
permitted to return to his ship. The captain at once wrote
to his brother to send him certain things, and he did so at
once. On their receipt the captain was allowed to go on
board, two men remaining behind with the things that had
been landed.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p>At this we rejoiced greatly, and rendered thanks to God
for having extricated us from the hands of people who had
no more sense than beasts, for we knew well that once the
captain was on board those who had been landed would
have nothing to fear. When the captain reached his ship
he ordered that no more merchandise should be sent.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>The Portuguese Merchandise at Pandarani, June 2-23.</i>]</p>

<p>Five days afterwards [on June 7] the captain sent word
to the king that, although he had sent him straight back to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>his ships, certain of his people had detained him a night
and a day on the road; that he had landed his merchandise
as he had been ordered, but that the Moors only came to
depreciate it; and that for these reasons he looked forward
to what he (the king) would order; that he placed no
value upon this merchandise, but that he and his ships were
at his service. The king at once sent word saying that
those who acted thus were bad Christians, and that he would
punish them. He, at the same time, sent seven or eight
merchants to inspect the merchandise, and to become
purchasers if they felt inclined. He also sent a man of
quality to remain with the factor already there, and
authorised them to kill any Moor who might go there,
without fear of punishment.</p>

<p>The merchants whom the king had sent remained
about eight days, but instead of buying they depreciated
the merchandise. The Moors no longer visited
the house where the merchandise was, but they bore
us no good-will, and when one of us landed they spat
on the ground, saying: “Portugal, Portugal.” Indeed
from the very first they had sought means to take and
kill us.</p>

<p>When the captain found that the merchandise found no
buyers at that place, he applied to the king for permission
to forward it to Calecut. The king at once ordered the
<i>bale</i> to get a sufficient number of men who were to
carry the whole on their backs to Calecut, this to be
done at his expense, as nothing belonging to the King
of Portugal was to be burthened with expenses whilst
in his country. But all this was done because it was
intended to do us some ill-turn, for it had been reported
to the king that we were thieves and went about
to steal. Nevertheless, he did all this in the manner
shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>The Merchandise removed to Calecut, June 24.</i>]</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 24th of June, being the day of St. John
the Baptist, the merchandise left for Calecut. The captain
then ordered that all our people should visit that town by
turns, and in the following manner:&mdash;Each ship was to
send a man ashore, on whose return another should be
sent. In this way all would have their turn, and would be
able to make such purchases as they desired. These men
were made welcome by the Christians along the road, who
showed much pleasure when one of them entered a house,
to eat or to sleep, and they gave them freely of all they
had. At the same time many men came on board our
ships to sell us fish in exchange for bread, and they
were made welcome by us. Many of them were accompanied
by their sons and little children, and the captain
ordered that they should be fed. All this was done for
the sake of establishing relations of peace and amity, and
to induce them to speak well of us and not evil. So great
was the number of these visitors that sometimes it was
night before we could get rid of them; and this was due to
the dense population of the country and the scarcity of
food. It even happened that when some of our men were
engaged in mending a sail, and took biscuits with them to
eat, that old and young fell upon them, took the biscuits
out of their hands, and left them nothing to eat.</p>

<p>In this manner all on board ship went on land by twos
and threes, taking with them bracelets, clothes, new shirts,
and other articles, which they desired to sell. We did not,
however, effect these sales at the prices hoped for when
we arrived at Moncobiquy [Moçambique], for a very fine
shirt which in Portugal fetches 300 reis, was worth here
only two fanôes,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> which is equivalent only to 30 reis, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>30 reis in this country is a big sum. And just as we sold
shirts cheaply so we sold other things, in order to take some
things away from this country, if only for samples. Those
who visited the city bought there cloves, cinnamon, and
precious stones; and having bought what they desired they
came back to the ships, without any one speaking to them.</p>

<p>When the captain found the people of the country so
well disposed, he left a factor with the merchandise, together
with a clerk and some other men.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Diogo Dias Carries a Message to the King, August 13.</i>]</p>

<p>When the time arrived for our departure the captain-major
sent a present to the king, consisting of amber, corals,
and many other things. At the same time he ordered the
king to be informed that he desired to leave for Portugal,
and that if the king would send some people with him to the
King of Portugal, he would leave behind him a factor, a clerk
and some other men, in charge of the merchandise. In return
for the present he begged on behalf of his lord [the King
of Portugal] for a bahar<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> of cinnamon, a bahar of cloves, as
also samples of such other spices as he thought proper, saying
that the factor would pay for them, if he desired it.</p>

<p>Four days were allowed to pass after the dispatch of this
message before speech could be had with the king. And
when the bearer of it entered the place where the king was,
he (the king) looked at him with a “bad face,” and asked
what he wanted. The bearer then delivered his message,
as explained above, and then referred to the present which
had been sent. The king said that what he brought ought
to have been sent to his factor, and that he did not want
to look at it. He then desired the captain to be informed
that as he wished to depart he should pay him 600
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>xerafins,<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> and that then he might go: this was the custom
of the country and of those who came to it. Diogo Dias,
who was the bearer of the message, said he would return with
this reply to the captain. But when he left [the palace]
certain men followed him, and when he arrived at the house
in Calecut where the merchandise was deposited, they put
a number of men inside with him to watch that none of
it was sent away. At the same time proclamation was
made throughout the town prohibiting all boats from
approaching our ships.</p>

<p>When they [the Portuguese] saw that they were prisoners,
they sent a young negro who was with them along the
coast to seek for some one to take him to the ships, and to
give information that they had been made prisoners by
order of the king. The negro went to the outskirts of the
town, where there lived some fishermen, one of whom took
him on board, on payment of three fanôes. This the
fisherman ventured to do because it was dark, and they
could not be seen from the city; and when he had put his
passenger on board he at once departed. This happened
on Monday, the 13th August, 1498.</p>

<p>This news made us sad; not only because we saw some
of our men in the hands of our enemies, but also because
it interfered with our departure. We also felt grieved
that a Christian king, to whom we had given of ours,
should do us such an ill turn. At the same time we
did not hold him as culpable as he seemed to be, for
we were well aware that the Moors of the place, who
were merchants from Mecca and elsewhere, and who knew
us, could ill digest us. They had told the king that we
were thieves, and that if once we navigated to his country,
no more ships from Mecca, nor from Quambaye [Cam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>bay],
nor from Imgros,<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> nor from any other part, would
visit him. They added that he would derive no profit
from this [trade with Portugal] as we had nothing to give,
but would rather take away, and that thus his country
would be ruined. They, moreover, offered rich bribes to
the king to capture and kill us, so that we should not
return to Portugal.</p>

<p>All this the captain learnt from a Moor of the country,<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a>
who revealed all that was intended to be done, warning the
captains, and more especially the captain-major, against
going on shore. In addition to what we learnt through
the Moor, we were told by two Christians that if the captains
went ashore their heads would be cut off, as this was the
way the king dealt with those who came to his country
without giving him gold.</p>

<p>Such then was the state of affairs. On the next day
[August 14] no boats came out to the ships. On the day
after that [August 15] there came an <i>almadia</i>, with four
young men, who brought precious stones for sale; but it
appeared to us that they came rather by order of the
Moors, in order to see what we should do to them, than for
the purpose of selling stones. The captain, however,
made them welcome, and wrote a letter to his people on
shore, which they took away with them. When the people
saw that no harm befell them, there came daily many merchants,
and others who were not merchants, from curiosity,
and all were made welcome by us and given to eat.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday [August 19] about twenty-five
men came. Among them were six persons of quality, and
the captain perceived that through these we might recover
the men who were detained as prisoners on land. He there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>fore
laid hands upon them, and upon a dozen of the
others, being eighteen<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> in all. The rest he ordered to be
landed in one of his boats, and gave them a letter to be
delivered to the king’s Moorish factor, in which he declared
that if he would restore the men who were being kept
prisoners he would liberate those whom he had taken.
When it became known that we had taken these men, a
crowd proceeded to the house where our merchandise was
kept, and conducted our men to the house of the factor,
without doing them any harm.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 23rd,<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> of the same month, we made
sail, saying we were going to Portugal, but hoped to be
back soon, and that then they would know whether we
were thieves. We anchored about four leagues to the
leeward of Calecut, and we did this because of the headwind.</p>

<p>On the next day [August 24] we returned towards the
land, but not being able to weather certain shoals in front
of Calecut, we again stood off and anchored within sight of
the city.</p>

<p>On Saturday [August 25] we again stood off and
anchored so far out at sea that we could scarcely see
the land. On Sunday [August 26] whilst at anchor,
waiting for a breeze, a boat which had been on the lookout
for us approached, and informed us that Diogo Dias
was in the king’s house, and that if we liberated those
whom we detained, he should be brought on board. The
captain, however, was of opinion that he had been killed,
and that they said this in order to detain us until they
had completed their armaments, or until ships of Mecca able
to capture us had arrived. He therefore bade them retire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>threatening otherwise to fire his bombards upon them, and
not to return without bringing him [Dias] and his men, or
at least a letter from them. He added that unless this
were done quickly he intended to take off the heads of his
captives. A breeze then sprang up, and we sailed along
the coast until we anchored.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>The King sends for Diogo Dias.</i>]</p>

<p>When the king heard that we had sailed for Portugal, and
that he was thus no longer able to carry his point, he
thought of undoing the evil he had done. He sent for
Diogo Dias, whom he received with marked kindness, and
not in the way he did when he was the bearer of [Vasco’s]
present. He asked why the captain had carried off these
men. Diogo Dias said it was because the king would not
allow him and his to return to the ships, and detained them
as prisoners in the city. The king said he had done well.
He then asked whether his factor had asked for anything,<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>
giving us to understand that he was ignorant of the matter,
and that the factor alone was responsible for this extortion.
Turning to his factor, he asked whether he was unaware
that quite recently he had killed another factor because he
had levied tribute upon some merchants that had come to
this country? The king then said: “Go you back to the
ships, you and the others who are with you; tell the
captain to send me back the men he took; that the pillar,
which I understood him to say he desires to be erected on
the land shall be taken away by those who bring you back,
and put up; and, moreover, that you will remain here with
the merchandise.” At the same time he forwarded a letter
to the captain, which had been written for him by Diogo
Dias with an iron pen upon a palm-leaf, as is the custom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>of the country, and which was intended for the King of
Portugal. The tenor<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> of this letter was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Vasco da Gama, a gentleman of your household, came to my
country, whereat I was pleased. My country is rich in cinnamon,
cloves, ginger, pepper, and precious stones. That which I ask of
you in exchange is gold, silver, corals and scarlet cloth.”</p></blockquote>

<p>[<i>Off Calecut, August 27-30.</i>] On Monday, the 27th of
this month, in the morning, whilst we were at anchor,
seven boats with many people in them brought Diogo
Dias and the other [Portuguese] who were with him. Not
daring to put him on board, they placed him in the captain’s
long boat, which was still attached to the stern.
They had not brought the merchandise, for they believed
that Diogo Dias would return with them. But once the
captain had them back on board, he would not allow them
to return to the land. The pillar<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> he gave to those in the
boat, as the king had given orders for it to be set up. He
also gave up, in exchange, the six most distinguished
among his prisoners, keeping six others, whom he promised
to surrender if on the morrow the merchandise were
restored to him.</p>

<p>On Tuesday [August 28], in the morning, whilst at
anchor, a Moor of Tunis,<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> who spoke our language, took
refuge on board one of our ships, saying, that all he had
had been taken from him, that worse might happen, and
that this was his usual luck. The people of the country,
he said, charged him with being a Christian, who had come
to Calecut by order of the King of Portugal; for this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>reason he preferred going away with us, rather than remain
in a country where any day he might be killed.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock seven boats with many people in them
approached us. Three of them carried on their benches
the striped cloth which we had left on land, and we were
given to understand that this was all the merchandise
which belonged to us.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> These three came to within a
certain distance of the ships, whilst the other four kept
away. We were told that if we sent them their men in
one of our boats they would give our merchandise in
exchange for them. However, we saw through their
cunning, and the captain-major told them to go away,
saying that he cared nought for the merchandise, but
wanted to take these men to Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> He warned them
at the same time to be careful, as he hoped shortly to be
back in Calecut, when they would know whether we were
thieves, as had been told them by the Moors.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 29th [of August], the captain-major
and the other captains agreed that, inasmuch that we had
discovered the country we had come in search of, as also
spices and precious stones, and it appeared impossible to
establish cordial relations with the people, it would be as
well to take our departure. And it was resolved that we
should take with us the men whom we detained, as, on our
return to Calecut, they might be useful to us in establishing
friendly relations. We therefore set sail and left for
Portugal, greatly rejoicing at our good fortune in having
made so great a discovery.</p>

<p>On Thursday [August 30], at noon, being becalmed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>about a league below [that is, north of] Calecut, about
seventy boats approached us.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> They were crowded with
people wearing a kind of cuirass made of red cloth, folded.
Their weapons for the body, the arms and the head were
these<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>.... When these boats came within the range of
our bombards, the captain-major ordered us to fire upon
them. They followed us for about an hour and a half,
when there arose a thunderstorm which carried us out to
sea; and when they saw they could no longer do us harm
they turned back, whilst we pursued our route.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Calecut and its Commerce.</i>]</p>

<p>From this country of Calecut, or Alta India,<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> come the
spices which are consumed in the East and the West,
in Portugal, as in all other countries of the world, as also
precious stones of every, description. The following spices
are to be found in this city of Calecut, being its own
produce: much ginger and pepper and cinnamon, although
the last is not of so fine a quality as that brought from an
island called Çillan [Ceylon],<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> which is eight days journey
from Calecut. Calecut is the staple for all this cinnamon.
Cloves are brought to this city from an island called
Melequa [Malacca].<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> The Mecca vessels carry these spices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>from there to a city in Mecca<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> called Judeâ [Jidda], and from
the said island to Judeâ is a voyage of fifty days sailing before
the wind, for the vessels of this country cannot tack. At
Judeâ they discharge their cargoes, paying customs duties
to the Grand Sultan.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> The merchandise is then transshipped
to smaller vessels, which carry it through the Red
Sea to a place close to Santa Catarina of Mount Sinai,
called Tuuz,<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> where customs dues are paid once more.
From that place the merchants carry the spices on the
back of camels, which they hire at the rate of 4 cruzados
each, to Quayro [Cairo], a journey occupying ten days.
At Quayro duties are paid again. On this road to Cairo
they are frequently robbed by thieves, who live in that
country, such as the Bedouins and others.</p>

<p>At Cairo the spices are embarked on the river Nile,
which rises in Prester John’s country in Lower India, and
descending that river for two days they reach a place
called Roxette [Rosetta], where duties have to be paid
once more. There they are placed on camels, and are
conveyed in one day to a city called Alexandria, which is
a sea-port. This city is visited by the galleys of Venice
and Genoa, in search of these spices, which yield the Grand
Sultan a revenue of 600,000 cruzados<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> in customs duties,
out of which he pays to a king called Cidadym<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> an annual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>subsidy of 100,000 cruzados for making war upon Prester
John. The title of Grand Sultan is bought for money, and
does not pass from father to son.</p>

<h3>[<span class="smcap">The Voyage Home.</span>]</h3>

<p>I now again speak of our voyage home.</p>

<p>Going thus along the coast we kept tacking, with the aid
of the land and sea breezes, for the wind was feeble.
When becalmed in the day we lay to.</p>

<p>On Monday, September 10, the captain-major landed
one of the men whom we had taken, and who had lost an
eye, with a letter to the Çamolin, written in Moorish
[Arabic] by one of the Moors who came with us.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> The
country where we landed this Moor was called Compia,<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>
and its king, Biaquolle, was at war with the King of
Calecut.</p>

<p>On the following day [September 11], whilst becalmed,
boats approached the ships, and the boatmen, who offered
fish for sale, came on board without exhibiting any fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Santa Maria Islands.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p>On Saturday, the 15th of said month, we found ourselves
near some islets, about two leagues from the land. We
there launched a boat and put up a pillar on one of these
islets, which we called Santa Maria, the king having ordered
three pillars (padrãos), to be named S. Raphael, S. Gabriel,
and Santa Maria. We had thus succeeded in erecting
these three, <i>scilicet</i>, the first, that of S. Raphael, on the Rio
dos bons signaes; the second, that of S. Gabriel, at
Calecut; and this, the last, named Santa Maria.</p>

<p>Here again many boats came to us with fish, and the
captain made the boatmen happy by presenting them with
shirts. He asked them whether they would be glad if he
placed a pillar upon the island. They said that they
would be very glad indeed, for its erection would confirm
the fact that we were Christians like themselves. The
pillar was consequently erected in much amity.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Anjediva, September 20 to October 5.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p>That same night, with a land breeze, we made sail and
pursued our route. On the following Thursday, the 20th
of the month,<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> we came to a hilly country, very beautiful
and salubrious, close to which there were six small islands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>There we anchored, near the land, and launched a boat to
take in water and wood to last us during our voyage across
the Gulf, which we hoped to accomplish, if the wind
favoured us. On landing we met a young man, who pointed
out to us a spring of excellent water rising between two
hills on the bank of a river. The captain-major gave this
man a cap, and asked whether he was a Moor or a Christian.
The man said that he was a Christian, and when told that
we too were Christians he was much pleased.</p>

<p class="tb">On the following day [September 21] an <i>almadia</i> came
to us with four men, who brought gourds and cucumbers.
The captain-major asked whether cinnamon, ginger, or any
other spices were to be found in this country. They said
there was plenty of cinnamon, but no other kind of spice.
The captain at once sent two men with them to the mainland
to bring him a sample, and they were taken to a wood
where a large number of trees yielding cinnamon were
growing, and they cut off two big branches, with their
foliage. When we went in our boats to fetch water we
met these two men with their cinnamon branches, and they
were accompanied by about twenty others, who brought the
captain fowls, cow-milk and gourds. They asked the captain
to send these two men along with them, as there was
much dry cinnamon not far off, which they would show
them, and of which they would bring samples.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></p>

<p>Having taken in water we returned to the ships, and
these men promised to come on the ensuing day to bring
a present of cows, pigs and fowls.</p>

<p>Early on the next morning [September 22] we observed
two vessels close to the land, about two leagues off, but
took no further notice of them. We cut wood whilst waiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>for the tide to enable us to enter the river to take in water,
and being thus engaged it struck the captain that these
vessels were larger than he had thought at first. He therefore
ordered us into the boats, as soon as we had eaten,
and sent us to find out whether these vessels belonged to
Moors or Christians. After his return on board, the captain-major
ordered a mariner to go aloft and look out for
vessels, and this man reported that out in the open sea
and at a distance of about six leagues he saw eight vessels
becalmed. The captain, when he heard this, at once gave
orders to sink these vessels. They, as soon as they felt
the breeze, put the helm hard a-lee, and when they were
abreast of us, at a distance of a couple of leagues, and we
thought they might discover us, we made for them. When
they saw us coming they bore away for the land. One
of them being disabled, owing to her helm breaking, the
men in her made their escape in the boat, which they
dragged astern, and reached the land in safety. We,
who were nearest to that vessel, at once boarded her, but
found nothing in her except provisions, coco-nuts, four jars
of palm-sugar, and arms, all the rest being sand used as
ballast. The seven other vessels grounded, and we fired
upon them from our boats.</p>

<p>On the following morning [September 23], whilst at
anchor, seven men in a boat visited us, and they told us that
these vessels had come from Calecut in search of us, and
that if they had succeeded in taking us we should have
been killed.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>

<p class="tb">On the following morning, having left this place, we
anchored at a distance of two bombard-shots from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>place at which we had been at first, and close to an island,
where we had been told that water would be found.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> The
captain-major at once sent Nicolau Coelho in an armed
boat in search for this watering place. He came there
upon the ruins of a large stone church which had been
destroyed by the Moors, with the exception of a chapel
which had been roofed with straw. This, at least, was told
us by the natives of the country, who prayed there to three
black stones which stood in the middle of the chapel.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a>
Beside this church we discovered a tank of the same
workmanship as the church itself&mdash;that is, built of hewn
stone&mdash;from which we took as much water as we needed.
Another tank, of large size and four fathoms deep, occupied
the highest part of the island. On the beach, in front of
the church, we careened the <i>Berrio</i> and the ship of the
captain-major. The <i>Raphael</i> was not drawn up on the
beach, on account of difficulties which will be referred to
further on.</p>

<p>Being one day in the <i>Berrio</i>, which was drawn up on the
beach, there approached two large boats, or <i>fustas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a>
crowded with people. They rowed to the sound of drums
and bagpipes, and displayed flags at the masthead. Five
other boats remained on the coast for their protection.
As they came nearer we asked the people whom we had
with us who they were. They told us not to allow them
to come on board, as they were robbers who would seize
us if they could. The people of this country, they said,
carried arms and boarded vessels as if they came as friends,
and having succeeded, and feeling strong enough, they laid
hands upon them. For this reason they were fired upon from
the <i>Raphael</i> and the captain-major’s ship, as soon as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>came within range of our bombards. They began to shout
“Tambaram,”<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> which meant that they were Christians,
for the Christians of India call God “Tambaram.” When
they found that we took no notice of this, they fled towards
the land. Nicolau Coelho pursued them for a short distance,
when he was recalled by a signal flag on the ship of
the captain-major.</p>

<p>On the following day, whilst the captain and many of
our people were on land, careening the <i>Berrio</i>, there arrived
two small boats with a dozen well-dressed men in them,
who brought a bundle of sugar-cane as a present for the
captain-major. After they had landed they asked permission
to see the ships. The captain thought they were
spies, and grew angry. Just then two other boats, with
as many people, made their appearance, but those who
had come first, seeing that the captain was not favourably
disposed towards them, warned these new-comers not to
land, but to turn back. They, too, re-embarked at once,
and went away.</p>

<p>Whilst the ship of the captain-major was being careened
there arrived a man,<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> about forty years of age, who spoke
Venetian well. He was dressed in linen, wore a fine <i>touca</i>
on his head, and a sword in his belt. He had no sooner
landed than he embraced the captain-major and the captains,
and said that he was a Christian from the west, who
had come to this country in early youth; that he was now
in the service of a Moorish lord,<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> who could muster
40,000 horsemen; that he, too, had become a Moor,
although at heart still a Christian. He said that, being one
day at his master’s house, news was brought that men had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>arrived at Calecut, whose speech none could understand,
and who were wholly clad; that when he heard this he
said that these strangers must be Franks, for this is the
name by which we [Europeans] are known in these parts.
He then begged permission of his master to be allowed to
visit us, saying that a refusal would cause him to die of
sorrow. His master thereupon had told him to go and tell
us that we might have anything in his country which
suited us, including ships and provisions, and that if we
desired to remain permanently it would give him much
pleasure. When the captain had cordially thanked him
for these offers, which appeared to him to have been made
in good faith, our visitor asked as a favour that a cheese
be given him, which he desired to take to one of his companions
who had remained on the mainland, as a token
that all had gone well. The captain ordered a cheese and
two soft loaves to be given to him. He remained on the
island, talking so much and about so many things, that at
times he contradicted himself.</p>

<p>Paulo da Gama, in the meanwhile, had sought the
Christians who had come with this visitor, and asked who
he was. They said he was a pirate (<i>armador</i>), who had
come to attack us, and that his ships, with many people in
them, had remained on the coast. Knowing this much, and
conjecturing the rest, we seized him, took him to the vessel
drawn up on the beach, and there began to thrash him,
in order to make him confess whether he was really a
pirate, or what was the object with which he had come
to us. He then told us that he was well aware that the
whole country was ill-disposed towards us, and that
numbers of armed men were around, hidden within the
creeks, but that they would not for the present venture to
attack us, as they were expecting some forty vessels which
were being armed to pursue us. He added that he did not
know when they would be ready to attack us. As to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
himself he said nothing except what he had said at first.
Afterwards he was “questioned”<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> three or four times, and
although he did not definitely say so, we understood from
his gestures that he had come to see the ships, so that he
might know what sort of people we were, and how we
were armed.</p>

<p>At this island we remained twelve days, eating much fish,
which was brought for sale from the mainland, as also
many pumpkins and cucumbers. They also brought us
boat-loads of green cinnamon-wood with the leaves still on.
When our ships had been careened, and we had taken in as
much water as we needed, and had broken up the vessel
which we had captured, we took our departure. This
happened on Friday, October 5.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p>Before the vessel referred to was broken up, its captain
offered us 1000 fanões for it, but the captain-major said
that it was not for sale, and as it belonged to an enemy he
preferred to burn it.</p>

<p class="tb">When we were about two hundred leagues out at sea,
the Moor whom we had taken with us declared that the
time for dissembling was now past. It was true that he
had heard at the house of his master that we had lost
ourselves along the coast, and were unable to find our
way home; that for this reason many vessels had been
despatched to capture us; and that his master had sent him
to find out what we were doing and to entice us to his
country, for if a privateer had taken us he would not have
received a share of the booty, whilst if we had landed
within his territory we should have been completely in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>his power, and being valiant men, he could have employed
us in his wars with the neighbouring kings. This reckoning,
however, was made without the host.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>The Voyage across the Arabian Sea.</i>]</p>

<p>Owing to frequent calms and foul winds it took us three
months less three days to cross this gulf,<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> and all our
people again suffered from their gums, which grew over their
teeth, so that they could not eat. Their legs also swelled,
and other parts of the body, and these swellings spread
until the sufferer died, without exhibiting symptoms of any
other disease. Thirty of our men died in this manner&mdash;an
equal number having died previously&mdash;and those able
to navigate each ship were only seven or eight, and even
these were not as well as they ought to have been. I
assure you that if this state of affairs had continued for
another fortnight, there would have been no men at all to
navigate the ships. We had come to such a pass that all
bonds of discipline had gone. Whilst suffering this
affliction we addressed vows and petitions to the saints on
behalf of our ships. The captains had held council, and
they had agreed that if a favourable wind enabled us we
would return to India whence we had come.</p>

<p>But it pleased God in his mercy to send us a wind which,
in the course of six days, carried us within sight of land,
and at this we rejoiced as much as if the land we saw had
been Portugal, for with the help of God we hoped to
recover our health there, as we had done once before.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></p>

<p>This happened on January 2, 1499.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> It was night
when we came close to the land, and for this reason we
put about ship and lay to. In the morning [January 3]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>we reconnoitred the coast, so as to find out whither the
Lord had taken us, for there was not a pilot on board, nor
any other man who could tell on the chart in what place
we were. Some said that we must be among certain
islands off Moçambique, about 300 leagues from the mainland;<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a>
and they said this because a Moor whom we had
taken at Moçambique had asserted that these islands were
very unhealthy, and that their inhabitants suffered from
the same disease which had afflicted us.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Magadoxo.</i>]</p>

<p>We found ourselves off a large town, with houses of several
stories, big palaces in its centre, and four towers around it.
This town faced the sea, belonged to the Moors, and was
called Magadoxo.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> When we were quite close to it we
fired off many bombards,<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> and continued along the coast
with a fair wind. We went on thus during the day, but
lay to at night, as we did not know how far we were from
Milingue [Malindi] whither we wished to go.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 5th of the month, being becalmed, a
thunderstorm burst upon us, and tore the ties of the
<i>Raphael</i>. Whilst repairing these a privateer came out from
a town called Pate<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> with eight boats and many men, but
as soon as he came within reach of our bombards we fired
upon him, and he fled. There being no wind we were not
able to follow him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Malindi.</i>]</p>

<p>On Monday, the 7th [of January]<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> we again cast anchor
off Milindy, when the king at once sent off to us a long boat
holding many people, with a present of sheep, and a message
to the captain-major, bidding him welcome. The
king said that he had been expected for days past, and
gave expression to his amicable and peaceable sentiments.
The captain-major sent a man on shore with these messengers
with instructions to bring off a supply of oranges,
which were much desired by our sick. These he brought
on the following day, as also other kinds of fruit; but our
sick did not much profit by this, for the climate affected
them in such a way that many of them died here. Moors
also came on board, by order of the king, offering fowls
and eggs.</p>

<p>When the captain saw that all this attention was shown
us at a time when we stood so much in need of it, he
sent a present to the king, and also a message by the
mouth of one of our men who spoke Arabic, begging for a
tusk of ivory to be given to the King [of Portugal], his
Lord, and asking that a pillar be placed on the land as a
sign of friendship. The king replied that he would do
what was asked out of love for the King of Portugal, whom
he desired to serve; and, in fact, he at once ordered a tusk
to be taken to the captain and ordered the pillar to be
erected.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>He also sent a young Moor,<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> who desired to go with us
to Portugal, and whom he recommended strongly to the
captain-major, saying that he sent him in order that the
King of Portugal might know how much he desired his
friendship.</p>

<p>We remained five days at this place enjoying ourselves,
and reposing from the hardships endured during a passage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>in the course of which all of us had been face to face with
death.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Malindi to São Braz.</i>]</p>

<p>We left on Friday [January 11], in the morning, and on
Saturday, which was the 12th of the month, we passed
close to Mombaça. On Sunday [January 13] we anchored
at the <i>Baixos de S. Raphael</i>,<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> where we set fire to the ship
of that name, as it was impossible for us to navigate three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>vessels with the few hands that remained to us. The
contents of this ship were transferred to the two other
ships. We were here fifteen days,<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> and from a town
in front of us, called Tamugate,<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> many fowls were
brought to us for sale or barter in exchange for shirts
and bracelets.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 27th, we left this place with a fair
wind. During the following night we lay to, and in the
morning [January 28] we came close to a large island
called Jamgiber [Zanzibar], which is peopled by Moors,
and is quite ten leagues<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> from the mainland. Late on
February 1, we anchored off the island of S. Jorge, near
Moçambique and left at once. On the following day [February 2], in the
morning, we set up a pillar in that island, where we had
said mass on going out. The rain fell so heavily that we
could not light a fire for melting the lead to fix the cross,
and it therefore remained without one. We then returned
to the ships.</p>

<p>On March 3 we reached the Angra de São Braz, where
we caught many anchovies, seals and penguins, which we
salted for our voyage. On the 12th we left, but when ten
or twelve leagues from the watering-place the wind blew
so strongly from the west, that we were compelled to return
to this bay.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>São Braz to the Rio Grande.</i>]</p>

<p>When the wind fell we started once more, and the Lord
gave us such a good wind that on the 20th we were able to
double the Cape of Good Hope. Those who had come so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>far were in good health and quite robust, although at
times nearly dead from the cold winds which we experienced.
This feeling, however, we attributed less to the
cold than to the heat of the countries from which we had
come.</p>

<p>We pursued our route with a great desire of reaching
home. For twenty-seven days<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> we had the wind astern,
and were carried by it to the neighbourhood of the island
of São Thiago. To judge from our charts we were within
a hundred leagues from it, but some supposed we were
quite near. But the wind fell and we were becalmed.
The little wind there was came from ahead. Thunderstorms,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a>
which came from the land, enabled us to tell our
whereabouts, and we plied to windward as well as we
could.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 25th of April, we had soundings of
35 fathoms. All that day we followed our route, and the
least sounding we had was 20 fathoms. We nevertheless
could get no sight of the land, but the pilots told us that
we were near the shoals of the Rio Grande.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p class="tb">[Here the Journal ends abruptly. The succeeding events
may be shortly stated. Vasco da Gama and Coelho were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>separated in a storm, according to Resende. Coelho continued
his voyage, arriving at Cascaes, below Lisbon, on
July 10, 1499. Vasco da Gama, having waited one day
for his consort, proceeded to the island of São Thiago,
placed João de Sá in charge of the <i>S. Gabriel</i>, and chartered
a caravel in which he conveyed his dying brother Paulo to
the island of Terceira. João de Sá arrived soon after Coelho,
and certainly anterior to August 28th, on which day the
king addressed a letter to the Cardinal Protector of Portugal
(see Appendix). Paulo died a day after he had landed at
the Angra of Terceira, and was buried in the church of the
Monastery of S. Francisco.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> A resident of Terceira, one
Arthur Rodriguez, at once started in a caravel to carry the
news of Vasco da Gama’s arrival to Lisbon.</p>

<p>The date of Vasco da Gama’s return to Lisbon is not
known with certainty. The commission appointed in 1871
to remove the remains of Vasco da Gama from the church
of Vidigueira to Belem made every effort to ascertain the
exact date, but in vain; and whilst Barros, Goes, and Pero
Barretto de Resende state that it happened on August 29th,
Castanheda fixes upon September 8th, and a MS. in the
Torre do Tombo, consulted by Texeira de Aragão, has
September 18th. Herculano, in a note to the second
edition of the “Roteiro”, is content with saying that it
happened at the end of August or at the beginning of
September. Texeira de Aragão assumes (on the ground
of a vague expression in De Barros) that he reached
Terceira on August 29th, arrived at Lisbon on September
9th, and made his triumphal entry into the town on September
18th. This assumption is partly supported by
the statement of Barros that Vasco da Gama, after his
arrival at Belem, on account of the loss he had suffered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>in the death of a beloved brother, spent nine days in
retirement.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p>I am myself inclined to believe that Vasco da Gama
reached Lisbon on August 29th, and made his triumphal
entry on September 8th.]</p>

of silk, and much silver. The distance from Calecut is 40
days’ sail, with a favourable wind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Melequa</span> [Malacca] is Christian with a Christian king.
It is 40 days’ sail from Qualecut [Calecut], with a good
wind. The king can muster 10,000 fighting men, including
1,200 horse. All cloves<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> come from here, being worth on
the spot 9 cruzados the bahar,<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> as also nutmeg, which is
worth the like amount. There is also much porcelain, much
silk and much tin, of which last they coin money; but this
money is heavy and of little value, 3 frazilas being worth
only 1 cruzado. There are many big parrots in this
country, whose plumage is red, like fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peguo</span> [Pegu] is Christian and has a Christian king. The
inhabitants are as white as we are. The king can muster
20,000 fighting men, <i>scilicet</i> 10,000 horse and the others on
foot, besides 400 war-elephants. This country produces
all the musk<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> of the world. The king possesses an island
about four days’ sail, with a good wind, from the mainland.
In this island there are animals like deer, who have pouches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>containing this musk, attached to their navels. At a certain
period of each year they rub themselves against trees,
when the pouches come off. It is then that the people of
the country gather them. Their abundance is such that
they give you four large pouches, or ten to twelve small
ones, which would fill a large chest, for one cruzado. On
the mainland many rubies<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> and much gold are found.
For ten cruzados as much gold may be bought here as for
twenty-five at Calecut. There is also much lac and benzoin
of two kinds, white and black. The frazila of white
benzoin is worth three cruzados, of black only a cruzado
and a half. The silver to be obtained here for ten cruzados
is worth fifteen at Calecut.</p>

<p>The distance of this country from Calecut is thirty days
with a fair wind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bemguala</span> [Bengal]<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> has a Moorish king, and is
inhabited by both Moors and Christians. Its distance
from Calecut is thirty-five days with a fair wind. There
may be 25,000 fighting men, <i>scilicet</i> 10,000 horse and the
remainder on foot, as also 400 war-elephants. In this
country the following merchandise is found:&mdash;much corn
and much cloth of great value. Cloth which may be
bought here for ten cruzados is worth forty at Calecut.
There is also much silver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conimata</span><a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> has a Christian king and Christian inhabitants.
It is fifty days’ sail from Calecut, with a good wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<p>The king can assemble five or six thousand men, and owns
one thousand fighting elephants. In this country there
are many sapphires and much brazil-wood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pater</span><a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> has Christian inhabitants and a Christian king,
and there is not a single Moor. The king can assemble
four thousand fighting men, and has a hundred war-elephants.
In this country is found much rhubarb, the
frazila on the spot being worth nine cruzados. There are
also many spinel rubies and much lac, a bahar of which is
worth four cruzados. The distance from Calecut is fifty
days with a fair wind.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">About Elephants.</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>How the Elephants fight in this country.</i></p>

<p>They make a house of wood holding four men, and this
house is put on the back of the elephant with the four men
in it. The elephant has attached five naked swords to each
of his tusks, being ten for the two tusks. This renders
him so redoubtable that none awaits his attack if flight is
possible. Whatever those seated on the top order to be
done is done as if he were a rational creature, for if they
tell him “kill this one, or do this thing or another”, he
does it.</p>

<p class="center padt1"><i>How they capture Elephants in the Primeval Forests.</i></p>

<p>When they wish to capture a wild elephant they take a
tame female, and dig a large hole on the track frequented
by elephants, and cover its mouth with brushwood. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>then tell the female “Go! and if you meet with an elephant,
entice him to this hole, in such a way that he falls
into it, but take care that you do not fall into it yourself.”
She then goes away, and does as she has been told, and
when she meets one she draws him on in such a way that
he must fall into the hole, and the hole is so deep that
unaided he could never get out of it.</p>

<p class="center padt1"><i>How they are got out of the hole and broken-in.</i></p>

<p>After the elephant has fallen into this hole, five or six
days are allowed to pass before he is given anything to
eat. When that time has elapsed, a man brings him a
very small supply of food, the supply being increased from
day to day until he eats by himself. This is continued
for about a month, during which time those who bring
him food gradually tame him, until at last they venture to
descend into the hole. This is done for several days until
he permits the man to put his hands upon his tusks.
He then goes into the hole and puts heavy chains around
the legs, and whilst in this condition they train him so well
that he learns all but to speak.</p>

<p>These elephants are kept in stables like horses, and a
good elephant is worth 2,000 cruzados.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></p>

<p>The draught of the letter addressed to the “Cardinal
Protector” also exists in the Torre do Tombo,<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> but is
evidently very illegible, for the text published by Texeira
de Aragão is full of blanks. The original, as also the
letter to Pope Alexander VI, to which reference is made,
may possibly be discovered in Rome. The letter is dated
August 28, 1499, that is, the day before Vasco da Gama’s
supposed return to Lisbon. It was certainly written <i>after</i>
the arrival of the <i>S. Gabriel</i>, for it refers to the “Moor of
Tunis” or Monçaide, to the “Jew”, who subsequently became
known as Gaspar da Gama, and to the men carried
off from Calecut, none of whom is likely to have been on
board Coelho’s small vessel.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></p>

<p>The “Cardinal Protector” can be identified with D.
Jorge da Costa, a man of mean extraction, whom Doña
Catharina, the virgin daughter of King Duarte, and sister
of King Afonso IV, appointed her chaplain, and who
subsequently rose to high dignities in the Church, until,
finally, the Pope bestowed upon him a cardinal’s hat.
King John took a dislike to the cardinal, who went to
reside at Rome; but King Manuel had a high opinion
of his wisdom, and soon after his accession, in 1495,
he invited him, through Pedro Correa,<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> his special ambassador
to the Court of Rome, to return to Lisbon.
The cardinal declined this invitation, pleading his great
age and infirmities as an excuse, but ever afterwards
attended most faithfully to the King’s business with the
Pope.</p>

Queen of Castile, July 1499.</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Most high and excellent Prince and Princess, most potent
Lord and Lady!</p>

<p>Your Highnesses already know that we had ordered <i>Vasco da
Gama, a nobleman of our household, and his brother Paulo da
Gama, with</i> four vessels to make discoveries by sea, and that
two years have now elapsed since their departure. And as the
principal motive of this enterprise has been, with our predecessors,
the service of God our Lord, and our own advantage,<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> it pleased
Him in His mercy to speed them on their route. From a
message which has now been brought to this city by one of the
captains,<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> we learn that they did reach and discover India and
other kingdoms <i>and lordships</i> bordering upon it; that they
entered and navigated its sea, finding large cities, large edifices
and rivers, and great populations, among whom is carried on all
the trade in spices and precious stones, which are forwarded in
ships (which these same explorers saw and met with in good
numbers and of great size) to Mecca, and thence to Cairo,
whence they are dispersed throughout the world. Of these
[spices, etc.] they have brought a quantity, including cinnamon,
cloves, ginger, nutmeg, <i>and pepper</i>, as well as other kinds,
together with the boughs and leaves<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> of the same; also many
fine stones of all sorts, such as rubies and others. And they also
came to a country in which there are mines of gold, of which
[gold], as of the spices and precious stones, they did not bring as
much as they could have done, for they took no merchandise
with them.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>As we are aware that your Highnesses will hear of these things
with much pleasure and satisfaction, we thought well to give this information.
And your Highnesses may believe, in accordance with
what we have learnt concerning the Christian people whom these
explorers reached, that it will be possible, notwithstanding that
they are not as yet strong in the faith or possessed of a thorough
knowledge of it, to do much in the service of God and the exaltation
of the Holy Faith, once they shall have been converted and
fully fortified (confirmed) in it. And when <i>they shall have thus been
fortified in the faith there will be an opportunity for destroying the
Moors of those parts. Moreover, we hope, with the help of God,
that</i> the great trade which now enriches the Moors of those parts,
through whose hands it passes without the intervention of other
persons or peoples, shall, in consequence of our regulations
(ordenanços) be diverted <i>to the natives and ships of our own
kingdom</i>, so that henceforth all Christendom, <i>in this part of
Europe</i>, shall be able, <i>in a large measure</i>, to provide itself with
these spices and precious stones. This, with the help of God,
who in His mercy thus ordained it, will cause our designs and
intentions to be pushed with more ardour [especially as respects]
the war upon the Moors <i>of the territories conquered by us in these
parts</i>, which your Highnesses are so firmly resolved upon, and in
which we are equally zealous.</p>

<p>And we pray your Highnesses, in consideration of this great
favour, which, with much gratitude, we received from Our Lord,
to cause to be addressed to Him those praises which are His due.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></p>

<p>Most high <i>and excellent Prince and Princess, most potent Lord
and Lady, may the Lord our God ever hold your persons and
kingdoms in His holy keeping</i>.</p>

<h3>GIROLAMO SERNIGI’S LETTERS ON VASCO DA
GAMA’S FIRST VOYAGE.</h3>
<hr />
<p>Girolamo Sernigi was born in Florence in 1453. His
father, Cipriano di Chimenti, was a member of the Clothiers’
Guild, and was held in high respect by his fellow citizens.
The family became extinct in 1680.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></p>

<p>Girolamo was residing at Lisbon, where he had settled as
a merchant, when Vasco da Gama’s expedition returned
from India. He remained there for many years afterwards,
and in 1510 commanded a vessel which went
out to Malacca with the fleet of Diogo Mendez de
Vasconcellos.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></p>

<p>In addition to the letters giving an account of the voyage
of Vasco da Gama, he wrote others dealing with the trade
between Portugal and India. Some of these will be found
in the <i>Diari</i> of Marino Sanuto.</p>

<p>Manuscript copies of these letters exist in the Biblioteca
Riccardiana, Florence (Codices 1910, f. 61, and 2112b), in
the library of Mr. Ralph Sneyd, of Newcastle-under-Lyne,
and possibly elsewhere. I am indebted to the mediation
of Dr. R. Garnett and the kindness of Professor Biagi,
chief librarian of the Biblioteca Mediceo-Laurenciana, at
Florence, for a careful copy of Codex 1910. The MS. in
the library of Mr. Sneyd formerly belonged to Count
Soranzo of Venice, and Prof. Guglielmo Berchet of that
city quotes passages from it in his valuable contribution to
the “Raccolta Colombiana”.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> I regret to say that I failed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>my endeavours to secure a copy of this valuable manuscript.
Fortunately, to judge from the few extracts given
by Prof. Berchet, there seems to be no reason to suppose
that it differs in any essential respect from the other documents
of which I was able to avail myself.</p>

<p>The two letters addressed to a gentleman at Florence
were published for the first time in Fracanzio di Montalboddo’s
famous <i>Paesi novamente retrovati</i>, Vicenza, 1507.
This seems to be a faithful reproduction of the original,
except that a few passages have been omitted, and that
the letters have been divided into chapters, each with a
distinctive heading. Ramusio,<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> who republished these
letters in 1550, has taken much greater liberties with their
writer. He has not merely improved his literary style,
but has also condensed many passages, not always very
happily, and suppressed others altogether. The more
important of these omissions, and occasional additions,
have been pointed out by me in the notes appended to the
present translation.</p>

<p>The writer’s name is not mentioned by Fracanzio or
Ramusio. Bandini<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> rashly suggested it was Amerigo
Vespucci, who addressed these letters to Dr. Lorenzo
di Pierfrancesco de’ Medici. Professor Kopke<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> devotes
several pages to a refutation of this untenable hypothesis.
It suffices to state that Vespucci was away with
Alonzo de Hojeda in the West Indies, from May 1499
to February 1500, and cannot consequently have been
at Lisbon in July 1499, when the first vessel of Vasco da
Gama’s fleet came back from India.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>To Baldelli Boni is due the credit of having first made
known the name of the actual writer, and of having directed
attention to the copy of the first letter existing in the
Riccardian library.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></p>

<p>The first of these letters was undoubtedly written immediately
after the arrival of Coelho’s vessel, on July 10th.
The information it conveys was obtained from various
members of the expedition, and there is at least one
passage in it which shows that it was not all written on the
same day.</p>

<p>The second letter was written some time afterwards, for
it embodies information obtained from the “pilot”, Gaspar
da Gama, who had not come back when the first letter was
written (see p. <a href="#Page_136">136</a>). This intelligent informant reached
Lisbon on board the flag-ship, the <i>S. Gabriel</i>, the command
of which had been entrusted by Vasco da Gama to his
clerk, João de Sá, when he himself left São Thiago in a
caravel for Terçeira.</p>

<p>Both these letters are addressed to a gentleman at
Florence with whom the writer was not on terms of
familiarity, and whom he consequently addresses as
“Vossignoria”. This need not, however, be translated as
“your Lordship”, for that style of address was customary
in the case of persons of much humbler degree.</p>

<p>The third letter is undoubtedly by the same writer. An
abstract of it, in German, was discovered among the papers
of Conrad Peutinger, of Augsburg, the antiquarian, and at
one time the owner of the famous <i>Tabula Peutingeriana</i>.
It was first published, together with other documents
dealing with early voyages to the New World and to
India, by Dr. G. Greiff, in 1861.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<p>Peutinger<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> was shown this letter during a temporary visit
to Rome, and made the abstract thus published. He
states explicitly that the letter was addressed to the
author’s <i>brother</i>. Covering the same ground as the preceding
letters, and written about the same time, it is only
natural that there should occur many similar passages;
and this would in all probability be even more apparent
if we were in a position to collate the letter seen by
Peutinger at Rome with that preserved in the “Riccardiana”.
But the letter, notwithstanding, is quite distinct
from the letters addressed to a gentleman in Florence.
The arrangement of the subjects dealt with is different, and
whilst we meet with paragraphs not to be found in either
of the other letters, there are numerous omissions. Among
these latter we may direct attention to the speculation
about the Chinese being Germans, which would most certainly
not have been passed over by a German.</p>

<p>The Peutinger letter was written after the captain had
come back “<i>a salvamento</i>” to Lisbon with the “one vessel”
of 90 tons, not previously accounted for. This definite
statement is rather puzzling, for if Vasco da Gama really
came home in his flagship, we are either compelled to
reject the statements of such well-accredited historians as
De Barros, Goes, and Castanheda, who affirm that the
captain-major ordered João de Sá to take his flagship, the
<i>S. Gabriel</i>, to Lisbon, whilst he himself chartered a swift
caravel which conveyed himself and his dying brother to
the Azores; or we must assume that João de Sá, having
refitted the <i>S. Gabriel</i> at São Thiago, joined his chief at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Terçeira, and returned with him to Lisbon.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> We are
inclined to believe that we have before us an inaccurate
statement made by the writer of the letter, or else an
erroneous rendering of his meaning by Peutinger. The
letter was certainly written after the arrival of João de Sá
in the <i>S. Gabriel</i>, but Vasco da Gama himself, coming
direct from Terçeira, may have reached Lisbon a day or
two later: these two distinct events becoming thus blended,
as it were, in the mind of a man not thoroughly informed
of the matter.</p>

<p>We have contented ourselves with printing a few
extracts from Peutinger’s letter.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>The Start.</i>]</p>

of 90 tons each, and one of 50 tons, in addition to which there
was a ship (navetta), of one hundred and ten tons, laden with
provisions. Between them they took away cxviij men,<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> and
they left this city of Lisbon on July 9 1497.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> Vasco da Gama
went as captain of this fleet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>The Voyage.</i>]</p>

<p>On July x 1499 the vessel of 50 tons came back to this city.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a>
The captain, Vasco da Gama, remained at the Cape Verde
islands with one of the vessels of 90 tons in order to land there
his brother Paulo da Gama, who was very ill.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> The other
vessel of 90 tons was burnt because there were not people
enough to navigate and steer her. The store-ship also was burnt,
for it was not intended she should return.</p>

<p>In the course of the voyage there died 55 men from a disease
which first attacked the mouth, and thence descended to the
throat; they also suffered great pain in the legs from the knee
downwards.</p>

<p>They discovered 1800 leagues<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> (each league being equal to 4¼
of our miles) of new land beyond the cape of Good Hope, which
cape was first discovered in the time of King John. Beyond
that cape they followed the coast for about 600 leagues<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> and met
with a dense population of black people. And when they had
made these 600 leagues they discovered a large river,<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> and at the
mouth of that river a great village inhabited by black people,
who are, as it were, subject to the Moors. These Moors live in the
interior of the country, and continually make war upon the blacks.
And in this river, according to these blacks, are found immense
quantities (infinite) of gold; and they told the captain that if he
would tarry a moon,<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> that is a month, they would give him gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>in plenty. But the captain would not wait, and went about 350
leagues<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> further, and discovered a great walled city, with very good
stone houses in the Moorish style, inhabited by Moors of the
colour of Indians. There the captain landed, and the Moorish
king of this city received him with much feasting (chon gran
festa), and gave him a pilot for crossing the gulf. This city is
called Melinde, and lies at the entrance of a gulf, the whole of
which is peopled by Moors. This pilot spoke Italian.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>The Arabian Sea.</i>]</p>

<p>This gulf is above 700 leagues across,<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> and they crossed it from
side to side, and came to a very large city, larger than Lisbon,
inhabited by Christians, and called Chalichut.</p>

<p>On both sides of this gulf there is a dense population of Moors,
with great towns and castles.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> At the termination of this gulf
there is a strait<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> like that of Romania,<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> and having passed through
this strait there is another and greater gulf, which is the Red
Sea. And from the right hand of this to the house of Mecca,
where is the tomb of Mohammed, is 3 days’ journey by land.
At the said house of Mecca is a very great town of Moors. I am
of opinion that this is the Gulf of Arabia,<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> concerning which Pliny
wrote that Alexander the Great went there, to make war, as also
did the Romans, who took all by war.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Chalichut.</i>]</p>

<p>Let us return to the above-named city of Chalichut, which is
bigger than Lisbon, and peopled by Christian Indians, as said.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>In this city are churches with bells,<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> but there are no priests, and
the divine offices are not performed nor sacrificial [masses]
celebrated, but in each church there is a pillar holding water, in
the manner of the fonts holding our holy water, and a second pillar
with balm. They bathe once every 3 years in a river which is
near the city.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> The houses in this city are of stone and mortar,
in the Moorish style, and the roads laid out and straight as are
these.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>An Audience.</i>]</p>

<p>And the king of this city is waited upon in grand style (molto
altamente), and keeps regal state, having his chamberlains, door-keepers,
and barons,<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> as also a very sumptuous palace. When the
captain of the said vessel arrived at the city the king was away at a
castle at a distance of about 6 leagues, and having been informed
that Christians had arrived he at once came to the city attended
by about 5000 persons.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> After the lapse of 3 days the king sent
for the captain, who had stayed in his vessel. The captain, with
xii of his men, went at once, and about 5000 persons accompanied
him from the shore as far as the palace of the king, at
the gate of which stood x doorkeepers with silver-mounted sticks.
Having entered he proceeded to a chamber where the king
reposed upon a low couch. The whole of the floor was covered
with green velvet,<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> whilst around it was drapery of variously-coloured
damask. The couch had a very fine white coverlet,
all worked with gold thread, and above it was a canopy, very
white, delicate and sumptuous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p>The king at once asked<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> the captain what he had come to
seek. The captain replied that it was the custom among Christians
that when an ambassador had to deliver his message to a
prince he should do so in secret and not in public. The king,
upon this, ordered all his people outside. The captain then
said that the King of Portugal had long since heard of his Highness
(alteza) and that he was a Christian king. Being desirous
of his friendship he had been ordered to visit him, as was the
custom between Christian kings.</p>

<p>The king received this message (ambascata) most graciously,
and ordered the Christian captain to be lodged in the house of
a very rich Moor.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Moorish Merchants.</i>]</p>

<p>In this city there reside many very wealthy Moorish merchants,
and all the trade is in their hands.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> They have a fine mosque<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a>
in the square of the town. The king is, as it were, governed
by these Moors because of the presents which they give him;
and owing to their industry<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> the government is wholly in their
hands, for these Christians are coarse people.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Spice Trade.</i>]</p>

<p>All kinds of spices are to be found in this city of Chalichut,
such as cinnamon, pepper, ginger, frankincense, lac; and brazil-wood
abounds in the forests. These spices do not grow here,
but<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> in a certain island at a distance of 160 leagues from this
city, near the mainland. It can be reached overland in xx days
and is inhabited by Moors.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> All the above spices are brought
to this city as to a staple.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Coins.</i>]</p>

<p>The coins most in circulation in this city are serafins of fine
gold, coined by the Sultan of Babylonia,<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> which weigh 2 or 3
grains less than a ducat, and are called serafins.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> There also
circulate some Venetian and Genoese ducats, as also small silver
coins, which must likewise be of the coinage of said sultan.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Merchandise.</i>]</p>

<p>There is abundance of silken stuffs, namely, velvets of various
colours,<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> satins, damask, taffetas, brocades worked in gold, scarlet
cloth, brass and tin ware.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> In fine, all these things are to be
found in abundance, and it is my opinion that the cloths worked
in gold and the silks are brought thither from Cairo.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Shipping.</i>]</p>

<p>The Portuguese remained three months at that town, namely,
from May 21<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> to August 25, and during that time there arrived
about 1,500 Moorish vessels in search of spices. The largest of
these vessels did not exceed 800 tons.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> They are of all sorts,
large and small. Having only one mast they can make headway
only with the wind astern, and sometimes are obliged to wait
from four to six months for fair weather [the monsoon or season].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>Many of these vessels are lost.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> They are badly built,<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> and very
frail. They carry neither arms nor artillery.</p>

<p>The vessels which visit the islands to carry spices to this city of
Chalichut are flat-bottomed, so as to draw little water, for there
are many dry places (shoals). Some of these vessels are built
without any nails or iron,<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> for they have to pass over the loadstone.</p>

<p>All the vessels, as long as they remain at this city, are drawn
up on the beach, for there is no port where they would be safe
otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Prices.</i>]</p>

<p>A load of cinnamon equal to 5 Lisbon cantars<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> is worth in that
city between x and xii ducats, or serafins, at most; but in the
islands where it is collected it is worth only half that sum. Pepper
and cloves are rated similarly. Ginger<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> and cinnamon are worth
more than any other spices, but lac is worth next to nothing, and
they ballast their vessels with it, that is calk them.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> Brazil-wood
abounds in the forests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>In payment they only take gold and silver; coral and other
merchandise of our parts they esteem but little,<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> linen-cloth
excepted, which I believe would find a ready market, as the
sailors bartered some of their shirts very profitably for spices,
although very fine white linen cloth, probably imported from
Cairo, is found there.</p>

<p>There is a custom-house in this city as elsewhere, and merchandise
pays a duty of 5 p. c.</p>

<p>The Portuguese who returned home brought a few precious
stones of little value, for, in truth, they had neither gold nor silver
to buy any. They say that these jewels are very dear there, as
also are pearls, but I believe they are to be had cheap. This is
my opinion, but those they bought were in the hands of Moorish
brokers, who sell at a fourfold profit. They have brought some
balasci,<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> sapphires and very small rubies, as also many garnets.
They say that the captain brings some valuable jewels, which he
bought with the silver which he had at his disposal, but as he has
not yet come back it is not known what he brings.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Trade with Egypt and East Africa.</i>]</p>

<p>Most of the vessels which lade spices at Chalichut cross the
large gulf, mentioned above, over which the pilot took them;
they then pass through the strait.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> The Red Sea is crossed in
smaller vessels, after which they proceed by land to the House of
Mecca, which is a journey of 3 days. They then take the route
for Cairo, past the foot of Mount Sinai, and through a desert of
sand where, they say, high winds sometimes raise the sand in
such a manner that it covers them. Some of the spice-vessels
visit all the cities of the gulf, others go to the mouth of the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>river,<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> where gold is found and a Moorish population, and there
discharge their cargoes.</p>

<p>They found in this city of Chalichut barrels of Malvasia<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> from
Candia, and I believe that they were brought from Cairo, as is
other merchandise.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Chinese Visitors.</i>]</p>

<p>It is now about 80 years since there arrived in this city of
Chalicut certain vessels of white Christians, who wore their hair
long like Germans, and had no beards except around the mouth,
such as are worn at Constantinople by cavaliers and courtiers.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a>
They landed, wearing a cuirass, helmet, and vizor, and carrying a
certain weapon [sword] attached to a spear. Their vessels are
armed with bombards, shorter than those in use with us. Once
every two years they return with 20 or 25 vessels. They are
unable to tell what people they are, nor what merchandise they
bring to this city, save that it includes very fine linen-cloth and
brass-ware. They load spices. Their vessels have four masts
like those of Spain. If they were Germans it seems to me that
we should have had some notice about them; possibly they may
be Russians if they have a port there. On the arrival of the
captain we may learn who these people are, for the Italian-speaking
pilot, who was given him by the Moorish king,<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> and
whom he took away contrary to his inclinations, is with him, and
may be able to tell.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Food.</i>]</p>

<p>Corn in abundance is found in this city of Chalichut, it being
brought thither by the Moors. For 3 reals,<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> which are smaller
than ours, bread sufficient for the daily sustenance of a man can
be purchased. Their bread is unleavened, resembling small
cakes, which are baked daily in the ashes. Rice, likewise, is
found in abundance. There are cows and oxen. They are small,
but yield much milk and butter. Oranges of indifferent flavour<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a>
are plentiful, as also lemons, citrons and limes, very good melons,<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a>
dates, fresh and dried, and great variety of other kinds of fruit.</p>

<p>The king of this city of Chalichut eats neither of meat nor fish
nor anything that has been killed, nor do his barons, courtiers,
or other persons of quality, for they say that Jesus Christ<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> said in
his law that he who kills shall die. For this reason they refuse to
eat anything that has been killed, and it is a great thing that they
should be able to support themselves without eating meat or fish.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a>
The common people eat meat and fish, but they do not eat oxen
or cows, for they hold these animals to be blessed (benedetto),
and when they meet an ox on the highway they touch him, and
afterwards kiss their hand, as a sign of great humility.</p>

<p>The king lives on rice, milk and butter,<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> and so do his barons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>and some of the other men of quality. And the king is waited
upon right royally at table. He drinks palm-wine out of a silver
cup. This cup he does not put to his mouth, but holds at some
distance and pours the wine down his throat.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Fish.</i>]</p>

<p>The fish are of the same kinds as are those of Portugal, namely,
perch,<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> soles,<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> bream,<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> salmon, mullets, and so of all other kinds.
And there are fishermen who go a-fishing<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> [soles and salmon].</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Elephants.</i>]</p>

<p>The Christians ride on elephants, of whom there are many:
they are domesticated. When the king goes to war most of his
people go on foot, but some are mounted on elephants; but
when he goes from place to place he causes himself to be
carried by some among the principal men of his court.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Dress.</i>]</p>

<p>All or most of these people are clothed in cotton-cloths from
the waist down to the knee, but from the waist upwards they go
naked. Courtiers and men of condition dress in the same
manner, but make use of silk-stuffs, reddish or scarlet or of other
colours, as seems good to them.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> The wives (ladies) of men of
condition are clothed above the girdle in very white and delicate
linen; but the wives of lower degree are naked above the

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Distance to Lisbon.</i>]</p>

<p>From this city of Chalichut to Lisbon is a distance of 3800
leagues,<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> and at the rate of 4½ miles to the league this makes
17,100 miles, and as much again for the return voyage. From
this the time in which such a voyage can be made may be judged,
it requiring from 15 to 16 months.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Native Navigation.</i>]</p>

<p>The mariners of that part, namely the Moors, do not guide
themselves by the Pole in navigating this gulf, but trust to
quadrants of wood.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> When they cross the gulf to that side, so
they were told by the pilot, they leave a thousand or more
islands<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> to the right; and whoever gets among these will be
lost as there are many rocks (shoals), and I am inclined to think
that they be those which were discovered by the King of Castile.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Prester John.</i>]</p>

<p>At the city of Chalichut they have some knowledge of Prester
John,<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> but not much, as he is far away. These Christians
believe that Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary, without
sin, was crucified and killed by the Jews, and buried at Jerusalem.
They also have some knowledge of the Pope of Rome, but know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>nothing of our faith beyond this. They [the people of Prester
John] have letters and a written language.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Articles of Commerce.</i>]</p>

<p>In this city are found many tusks of elephants, also much
cotton, sugar and sweetmeats, and all the wealth of the world
seems now to have been discovered.</p>

<p>I presume that wine would prove a good article in these parts,
and very acceptable to these Christians. Oil, too, is in demand.</p>

<p>Justice is strictly administered in this city. Robbers, murderers,
and other malefactors are incontinently impaled in the
Turkish fashion; and whoever defrauds the king’s excise (customs)
is punished by having his merchandise confiscated.</p>

<p>Civet, musk, ambergris and storax are met with.<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Spice Islands.</i>]</p>

<p>The island where the spices grow is called Zilon, and is 60<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a>
leagues from said city. In that island grow the trees which yield
very good cinnamon; as also pepper.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> However, there is still
another island [in which spices grow]. Cinnamon and pepper
also grow on the mainland, around this city, but the quality is
inferior to the products of the islands. Ginger grows on the
mainland, and is of very good quality. Cloves grow at a great
distance. Of rhubarb there is much, and many other kinds of
spices are found there, as also many almonds.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>The Arabian Sea.</i>]</p>

<p>I stated above that the gulf was wholly peopled by Moors,
but I have since<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> learnt that this is not the case. Only the shore
on this side [the west], where is the city of Melinde, is wholly
inhabited by white Moors, whilst the further [eastern] shore is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>peopled by Christian Indians, who are white as we are. Along
the coast and throughout the mainland much corn, meat and fruit
are produced.</p>

<p>The country around the city of Melinde is very fertile, and
many of these provisions are shipped from it to Chalichut, for most
of the land around the latter is sandy and yields no fruit.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>The Monsoons.</i>]</p>

<p>There are only two dominant winds in those parts, namely
westerly and easterly winds, and it is winter during the former
and summer during the latter.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Artists.</i>]</p>

<p>There are many excellent painters in this city of Ghalinde,<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> of
figures as well as of other subjects.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Architecture.</i>]</p>

<p>Neither Ghalinde nor any of the other cities is enclosed within

Moorish style, of stone and mortar, and streets regularly laid
out (ordinate).<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since I sent you full particulars about India and its discovery
there has arrived here the pilot whom they took by force. He
appeared to be a Sclavonian and turns out to be a Jew, born at
Alexandria, or in those parts, and thence went to India when
very young. At Calichut he has a wife and children. He owned
a ship and went several times to sea.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Spices.</i>]</p>

<p>This man told wonderful things about those countries, and
their wealth in spices. The best and finest cinnamon is procured
from another island [Ceylon], about 150 leagues beyond Calichut
and very near the mainland. This island is inhabited by Moors.
Pepper and cloves come from more distant parts.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Jews.</i>]</p>

<p>He says that there are not many Jews there; and that there is
a King of the Jews of the ten tribes of the Jewish people which
went out of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Christians.</i>]</p>

<p>He says that in those countries there are many gentiles, that is
idolaters, and only a few Christians;<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> that the supposed churches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
and belfries are in reality temples of idolaters, and that the
pictures within them are those of idols and not of Saints. To
me this seems more probable than saying that there are Christians
but no divine administrations, no priests and no sacrificial mass.
I do not understand that there are any Christians there to be taken
into account,<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> excepting those of Prester John, whose country is
far from Calichut, on this [<i>i.e.</i>, the western] side of the Gulf of
Arabia, and borders upon the country of the King of Melinde,
and, far in the interior, upon the Ethiopians, that is the black
people of Guinea, as also upon Egypt, that is the country of the
Sultan of Babylon [Cairo]. This Prester John has priests, who
offer sacrifices, respect the Gospels and the Laws of the Church,
much as is done by other Christians.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Trade with Egypt.</i>]</p>

<p>The Sultan has a port on the Red Sea, and the route from
Alexandria to that port passes throughout through his territories,
it being a journey of quite lxxx days.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> At that port all spices
coming from Calichut are discharged.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>A Pearl Fishery.</i>]</p>

<p>There is an island about a league from the mainland,<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> inhabited
by fishermen, who do nothing but fish for pearls. There is no
water in the island, and many barges go daily to a large river on
the mainland where they are filled with water&mdash;no tubs or
barrels being used. When the animals of the island see these
barges return, they immediately hasten to the shore to drink out
of these barges. Pearls are not fished at any island except this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>one which lies quite 60 leagues<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> this side of Calichut. It is
inhabited by gentiles, who set great store by cows and oxen,
whom they almost worship, so that anyone discovered to have
eaten beef is adjudged guilty of death.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Taprobana.</i>]</p>

<p>Taprobana, concerning which Pliny wrote so fully, was not
known to the pilot, for it must be quite out at sea, far away from
the mainland.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>A Pagoda.</i>]</p>

<p>At Calichut there is a temple and whoever enters it before
noon on a seventh Wednesday dies<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> because of diabolical apparitions.
The Jewish pilot affirms that this is most certainly true,
and that on a certain day of the year some lamps in this same
temple begin to burn spontaneously and cause many deformities
of nature to appear.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Moorish Navigation.</i>]</p>

<p>He, moreover, stated that in those seas they navigate without
compasses, but with the aid of quadrants of wood. This seems
to be a difficult thing to do, especially during a fog, when it is
impossible to see the stars. They also have a kind of very small
anchor, but I do not know how it is used.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> The planks of their
vessels are held together by cords, and they are three palms longer
than the beam. All the vessels of that country are built at
Calichut, for no wood is found elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Suitable Exports.</i>]</p>

<p>The articles of merchandise most suitable for that country
seem to be coral, copper kettles and thin plates of the same
metal; tartar, spectacles (for there are countries where a pair of
them fetches a high price), coarse linens, wine, oil, thin brocades,
and also boccasins, that is cloths. The said Jew has thrown
much light on all these matters.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Plans of King Manuel.</i>]</p>

<p>Our King of Portugal is very keen in this matter and has
already ordered four vessels to be got ready, besides two caravels,
well armed, to sail in January with plenty of merchandise.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a>
Should the King of Calicut not allow the Portuguese to trade in
those countries, the captain of these vessels is instructed to
capture as many native craft as he can. In my opinion he will
be able to capture as many as he chooses, for they are frail, and
so badly constructed that they can only sail before the wind.
Of these native vessels, engaged in the spice trade, there are very
many.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Elephants.</i>]</p>

<p>The principal animals of this country are elephants, which they
employ in war. On the back of the animal they place a kind of
castle sheltering three or four fighting men, in addition to whom
there is one man, and he the most important, who guides the
animal, as described by Pliny.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> Some kings there are who
have 1500 elephants each, others a thousand and others eight
hundred, according to the extent of their dominions. When
they wish to beach their ships they do so by the strength of these
animals, and they make them run, which seems fabulous, but is
nevertheless true.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>Precious Stones.</i>]</p>

<p>Those who have returned say that precious stones (jewels) are
plentiful, but dear in comparison with other merchandise. Neither
the captain nor the others have brought back jewels worth taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>into account, and this makes me think that they are not found
there, but come from afar. The princes and kings of those
countries value precious stones very much.</p>

<p>Storax, benzoin, civet and similar things are not as plentiful
there as I was led to believe.</p>

<p class="center padt1">[<i>The Royal Title.</i>]</p>

<p>Our king has taken a title from those countries, viz. King of
Portugal and Algarve on this and on the other side of the sea, in
Africa, Lord of Guinea, and of the conquest, the navigation and
commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia and India.</p>

<p>This is what I was able to learn from some persons of intelligence
who returned with this fleet. And if I have written it
down somewhat at random you, Sir,<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> will pardon and excuse me.</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>The four vessels left Lisbon on July 10, 1499 ... The
captain remained behind with three vessels, because his brother
Paulo da Gama, was sick unto death. He landed him at an
island called Capo Verde, far from Lisbon, and burnt two
vessels, the one of 110 tons and one of 90 tons, so that they
might not fall into the hands of the heathen [Mohammedans],
for 55 of his people had died, and he was unable to bring these
ships home with the remaining 63 men. Afterwards the captain
came <i>a Sambameno</i> (<i>a salvamento</i>, safely) back to Lisbon with the
one ship.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>... On the voyage out from Lisbon the vessels came to
some distant islands where they [the Portuguese] had been
before.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> Beyond these islands they came to a gulf, or arm of
the sea, which they crossed, having the land always to the left
and the broad sea to the right....</p>

<p>Various kinds of spices are brought from distant islands to
Colokutt. Pepper, brazil-wood, <i>grao</i>,<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> cinnamon, frankincense,
lac, are to be found there. These things abound and are worth
next to nothing. Of brazil-wood there is plenty. There are likewise
many ivory tusks and various other kinds of merchandise,
such as variously-coloured silk-stuffs, costly cloth worked in gold,
fine white linen, and woollen-stuffs, such as bocassins of various
colours, and also much cotton. It is thought that the silver
stuffs and cloths, as also the linens, come from Alkeiro (Cairo).</p>

<p>... Most of the spices brought to Kalikut are said to
come from the island of Zelong (Ceylon). Only heathen live in
that island, and the king is a heathen [Moor]. It is at a distance
of 160 leagues from Kalekutt, and only one league from the
mainland. By land it is a journey of twenty days. In the island
are forests of brazil-wood and roseberries,<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> and other spices,
including cloves and rhubarb, are found. Some minor spices
come from more distant islands. Cinnamon is imported from
Ceylon ...</p>

<h3>THREE PORTUGUESE ACCOUNTS OF VASCO DA
GAMA’S FIRST VOYAGE (1608-1646).</h3>
<hr />
<h3>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jornal das Viagens dos Portuguezes as
Indias, 1608.</span></h3>

<p>The late Visconde de Santarem, in his <i>Noticia dos
Manuscriptos</i>, 2nd edition, Lisbon, 1863, p. 93, draws
attention to the existence of a MS. in the Bibliothèque
Nationale at Paris, which in his opinion furnishes most
valuable chronological information on the Portuguese
voyages to India, from 1497 to 1632. We have translated
from this codex all that refers to the first voyage of Vasco
da Gama; and a perusal of the translation will, we think,
convince the reader that he has before him, not a document
based upon authentic sources, but a compilation of very
doubtful value.</p>

<p>We have examined three copies, or rather editions,
of this <i>Jornal das Viagens dos Portuguezes ás Indias</i>,
viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Bibl. Nat. Port. 8, No. 85.</i> This is the earliest of the
three MSS., for it only extends to the year 1608. On
folio 206<sup>b</sup> is a statement to the effect that it was copied
in 1618 from a MS. in the possession of the Conde de
Vidigueira.</p>

<p>2. <i>Bibl. Nat. Port. 46.</i> This, formerly, bore the number
10023, and is the MS. described by Santarem. It is
identical with Port. 8, except that its information is extended
to the year 1632.</p>

<p>3 <i>British Museum Add. MSS. 20902.</i> This is the MS.
quoted by Dr. Walter de Gray Birch (<i>The Commentaries</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
<i>of the Great Afonso Dalboquerque</i>, ii, p. xvi). It is still
more recent than the preceding, having been extended by
an unknown author to the year 1653. A list of the
Viceroys up to 1610 is appended. The marginal notes are
derived from Pedro Barretto de Rezende’s <i>Livro das
Armadas</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center padt1"><span class="smcap">The Year 1497.</span></p>

<p>On the second of June, 1497, there set sail from Lisbon for
the discovery of Oriental India, Vasco da Gama, the second son
of Estevão da Gama, comptroller (veador) of the household of the
King Don Affonso V, and of Doña Isabel Sodré, his wife, as
captain-major of four vessels: himself in the <i>São Raphael;</i> Paulo
da Gama, his elder brother, in the <i>São Gabriel;</i> Nicolao Coelho
in the <i>São Miguel</i>.</p>

<p>Gonçalo Nunes was captain of a vessel carrying provisions,
which this side (<i>antes</i>) the Cape of Good Hope were transferred
to the other vessels, when he returned to this kingdom [of
Portugal]. And the vessel <i>S. Gabriel</i>, in which went Paulo da
Gama, being much dilapidated, so as to be unable to continue the
voyage, was broken up for the purpose of repairing the other
vessels, in a river of Cafraria, beyond the Cape of Good Hope,
which was named the river of Mercy. And Paulo da Gama
went over to the vessel of his brother, while his people were
distributed among the two vessels. Thence they continued their
voyage.</p>

<p>Having come to an anchor at Moçambique, where the Sheikh
attempted to take the vessels by treachery, they disembarked at
the island of São Jorge, where was celebrated the first mass beyond
the Cape of Good Hope. Thence they went to Quiloa and
Mombaça, and the kings of all these islands attempted to act
treacherously, but God would not permit their success.</p>

<p>At Melinde the King made them honestly welcome, and gave
them trustworthy pilots, who guided them to Angediva, where
they fought the fustas of the Sabayo, the governor of Goa, over
whom they gained the victory. And thence they went to Calicut,
where the Samori planned many treacherous acts which took no
effect. Thence they went to Cochin, where the King received
them well, and to Cananor, in the same manner. There they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
completed the loading of the two vessels, and returned to this
kingdom, arriving safely at Lisbon on September 18th, 1499.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></p>

<p>Paulo da Gama died of an illness in the island of Terçeira, at
the city of Angra, and lies buried in the monastery of São
Francisco of that city.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">II.&mdash;Luiz de Figueiredo Falcão, 1612.</span></h3>

<p>Luiz de Figueiredo Falcão was secretary of King Philip II
of Portugal (Philip III of Spain), and is the compiler of a
<i>Livro em que se contem toda a Fazenda, &amp; Real Patrimonio
dos Reynos de Portugal, India, ilhas adjacentes de sua coroa</i>,
which was printed by order of the Portuguese Government
in 1859.</p>

<p>The Preface is dated “Madrid, October 20, <span class="smcap">MDC.VII</span>”, but
this is evidently a misprint, for reference is made in it to a
list of captains who went to India since 1497 as containing
information up to the year 1612; and instead of VII, we
ought therefore to read <span class="smcap">XII</span>, the date of the book being
thus 1612.</p>

<p>The author had access to the original records in the
India House, and claims to have expended three years
upon the compilation of his work, which certainly contains
a mass of information of the highest interest. Neverthe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>less,
his book is not free from errors, many of which have
already been pointed out by Cunha Rivara in an Appendix
to a translation of the <i>Viagem de Francisco Pyrard</i>, published
at Nova Goa in 1858. Texeira de Aragão (<i>Boletim</i>,
Lisbon Geographical Society, vi, p. 578) also warns against
accepting without question all the statements made by this
author.</p>

<p>We quote the following information on Vasco da Gama’s
first voyage from a “List of Captain-majors and Captains
who went to India since 1497”, p. 137:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center padt1">1497.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the year 1497 there departed for India Vasco da Gama, the
first discoverer, as captain-major of four vessels. He left Lisbon
on July 8th, 1497.</p>

<table style="font-size: 1em;" summary="ships"><tr>

<p>The <i>Berrio</i>, with her captain, returned and reached the bar of
Lisbon on July 10th, 1499.</p>

<p>Vasco da Gama went from India to Cape Verde, where he
remained with his brother, Paulo da Gama, who died there, and
whose body he conveyed to the island of Terçeira, and he sent
one of his servants with the <i>São Raphael</i> to Lisbon.</p>

<p>Vasco da Gama himself reached Lisbon in a caravel on August
29th, two years and nearly two months after he had left that port.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to point out that the flagship was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
the <i>São Gabriel</i>, and that Paulo da Gama came back in
that vessel and not in the store-ship. It was, indeed,
Paulo’s own ship, the <i>São Raphael</i>, which was burnt off
Tangáta.</p>

<p>As an instance of the author’s inconsistencies, we need
only quote the following passage from a “Summary Statement
of Vessels which left Portugal for India”, p. 194:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Between July 10th, 1499, on which day there arrived in the
port of Lisbon the ship <i>São Raphael</i>, in which Vasco da Gama
had gone to India in 1497, and 1612, there came back from
India 425 vessels.</p>

<p>It was the <i>Berrio</i> which came back on July 10th, the
<i>São Raphael</i> having been burnt off Mtangata; and Vasco
da Gama did not go in the <i>S. Raphael</i>, by the author’s own
(erroneous) statement.</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<h3><span class="smcap">III.&mdash;Pedro Barretto de Rezende, 1646.</span></h3>

<p>Captain Pedro Barretto de Rezende, a professed Knight
of the Order of St. Benedict of Aviz, and a native of Pavia,<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a>
is the author of a <i>Livro do Estado da India</i>, consisting of
three Parts and an Appendix, of which MS. copies exist
in the British Museum (Sloane Collection, No. 197) and the
Bibliothèque Nationale (Port. 1, and Port. 36). Part <span class="smcap">I</span> of
this work contains a succinct account of the doings of the
Viceroys of India up to 1634, and gives portraits of all of
them; Parts <span class="smcap">II</span> and <span class="smcap">III</span> contain plans of the Portuguese
forts between the Cape of Good Hope and China, with
descriptions; whilst the Appendix furnishes an account of
the “armadas” or fleets which were sent to India up to
1605.</p>

<p>Dr. Walter de Gray Birch (<i>Commentaries of the Great</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>

<p>If this valuable document should ever be printed, it will
be necessary to collate the copies existing in London,
Paris, and probably also elsewhere, for they are not in all
respects identical. Port. 36 seems to me to deserve the
preference as far as respects Part <span class="smcap">I</span>, but Part <span class="smcap">II</span> (the description
of the forts) has been abridged, as compared with
Port. 1. The portraits in this latter are more neatly done
than in Port. 36. No reference to the source of these full-length
portraits is made by the author. They certainly
differ from the portraits designed in 1547 by a native artist
under the supervision of Gaspar Correa, and published in
the Lisbon edition of his <i>Lendas</i> (see t. iv, p. 596). Lord
Stanley (<i>Vasco da Gama</i>, p. ix) says that Correa’s portraits
are “better” than those in Rezende’s work. All that we can
say is that they are not worse. Our full-length portrait
is from a MS. of Barretto de Rezende in the Bibliothéque
Nationale, as reproduced in Charton’s <i>Voyageurs anciens
et modernes</i>. The small oval portrait is from a copy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Correa’s painting which was made by order of D. Francisco,
da Assumpção de Brito, who was installed Archbishop of
Goa in 1774. It was first published in 1817 in a work
entitled <i>Retratos e Elogios de Varões e Donas</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center padt1"><span class="smcap">First Voyage, 1497; Four Sails.</span></p>

<p>King John II of Portugal having died without a legitimate son,
Dom Manuel was proclaimed King on October 27th, 1495; and
as this fresh dignity entailed that he should prosecute the undertakings
initiated by his predecessors, he proposed to himself to go
on with the discovery of Oriental India by sea, which, seventy-five
years before, had been set going.</p>

<p>In 1496 he had many councils on this affair, and in consequence
of the resolutions arrived at he agreed (<i>assentou</i>) to despatch on
this enterprise one Vasco da Gama, and forthwith arranged for
the fleet to be sent, the work upon which was carried on with
such expedition that rigging and all was ready by Saturday,
July 8th, 1496.</p>

<p>The fleet (<i>armada</i>) only included three ships of from 100 to
320 tons, and there went in them, between sailors and soldiers,
260 persons. In addition there was a ship carrying provisions.</p>

<p>The flag-ship, in which Vasco da Gama, the captain-major,
embarked, was called the <i>São Gabriel</i>, and Pero de Alemquer
was the pilot. The second ship was called the <i>São Raphael</i>;
Paulo da Gama, the brother of said Vasco, was captain, and João
de Coimbra, pilot.</p>

<p>The third vessel was called the <i>Berrio</i>; Nicolao Coelho was
her captain and P<sup>o</sup>. Escolar her pilot.</p>

<p>Gonsalo Nunes, a retainer (<i>criado</i>) of Vasco da Gama, was
captain of the cargo-ship (<i>nao</i>); only provisions went in her.
These, as also the crew, having been transferred to the other
ships at the Cape of Good Hope, they set fire to her.</p>

<p>They set sail from the bar of Lisbon on July 8th, 1497, arrived
at Moçambique on March 1st, 1498, made Mombasa on Palm
Sunday, the 7th of April,<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> and Melinde on the 15th of the same
month.</p>

<p>There he took pilots to guide him to India, and on May 16th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>of the same year, ’498,<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> he made the land at a port on the coast
of Mallavar (Malabar), in the kingdom of the Samorim, two
leagues below Callecut, which is the principal city and capital of
that kingdom. There he remained seventy-four days, in the
course of which, induced thereto by the Moors who live in that
country, he practised upon us a thousand deceits. But having
discovered that for the sake of which he had been sent, namely,
India, of which he was able to take home such good intelligence,
he determined to return to Portugal, and set sail on August 29th
of this same year, namely, ’498. At the Anjediva islands he
careened the ships and took in water, and there he took a Jew
who, by order of Sabayo, the King of Goa, had visited him, it
being the intention, immediately after the return of this Jew, to
send a fleet against him (Vasco da Gama).</p>

<p>Vasco da Gama departed thence and made the coast of Melinde.
Wishing to depart thence for this kingdom, the ship <i>São Raphael</i>,
in which was his brother, was lost on the same shoals on which
she had already once grounded on the way out to India. The
loss of this ship did not give much concern to Vasco da Gama,
for he was short of men, and those in her were distributed among
the two other vessels. He passed Moçambique, doubled the
Cape of Good Hope on March 20th, 1499; when near the Cape
Verde Islands a severe storm separated the two vessels, namely,
that in which he (Vasco) was from her consort in which was
Nicolau Coelho, who, leading, lost sight of Vasco da Gama, and
reached the bar of Lisbon<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> on July 10th of said year.</p>

<p>Vasco da Gama only arrived on August 29th in a caravel, for
his brother, Paulo da Gama, being very ill, he went from the
island of São Thiago to that of Terçeira, allowing his ship to be
taken to Lisbon by João de Sá.</p>

<p>And Vasco da Gama buried his brother, whose death much
afflicted him, in the island of Terçeira, and after that landed at
Lisbon on August 29th, as stated above, or two years after he had
started on his discovery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>From the <i>Livro das armadas e capitaes que forão a India</i>,

<i>Livro do estado da India</i>, we take the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

had been passed, and beyond the Aguada (watering-place) of

<p>The ship of Paulo da Gama stranded on the voyage home to
Portugal on the shoals between Guilva [Kilwa] and Mombaça,

the two companion-ships.</p></blockquote>

<h3>VASCO DA GAMA’S SHIPS AND THEIR
EQUIPMENT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> authorities agree that the fleet, or armada, fitted out
for Vasco da Gama’s voyage numbered four vessels, but
they are not agreed as to the names which these vessels
bore. We are not, however, likely to be misled if we
accept the unanimous testimony of the author of our
<i>Roteiro</i>, of João de Barros, Lopez de Castanheda, Pedro
Barretto de Rezende, and Manuel Faria y Sousa: according
to whom the names of the ships and of their principal
officers were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>S. Gabriel</i> (flag-ship).&mdash;Vasco da Gama, captain-major; Pero
d’Alenquer, pilot; Gonçalo Alvarez, master; Diogo Dias, clerk.</p>

<p><i>S. Raphael.</i>&mdash;Paulo da Gama, captain; João de Coimbra
pilot; João de Sá, clerk.</p>

<p><i>Berrio.</i>&mdash;Nicolau Coelho, captain; Pero Escolar, pilot; Alvaro
de Braga, clerk.</p>

<p><i>Store-ship.</i>&mdash;Gonçalo Nunes, captain.</p></blockquote>

<p>Correa and the unknown author of the <i>Jornal das
Viagens</i> (p. 145) call the “Berrio” <i>S. Miguel</i>, and make the
<i>S. Raphael</i> the flag-ship; whilst L. de Figueiredo de Falcão
(p. 147) substitutes a <i>S. Miguel</i> for the <i>S. Raphael</i>. It is
just possible that the vessel popularly called <i>Berrio</i>, after
its former owner, had been re-christened <i>S. Miguel</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Berrio</i> was one of those swift lateen-rigged vessels
for which Portugal was famous from the thirteenth to the
beginning of the sixteenth century, and which, after the
<i>barinel</i><a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> had been discarded, were exclusively employed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>the exploration of the African coast. Their burthen did
not exceed 200 tons, and they had two or three masts, and
occasionally even four.<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> The <i>Berrio</i> is stated to have been
a vessel of only 50 tons. She was named after her former
owner and pilot,<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> of whom she was purchased expressly for
this voyage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i158.jpg" width="300" height="310" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A Caravel.<br />
(<i>After a Painting of the sixteenth century, in the Monastery of the
Mother of God at Lisbon.</i>)</p></div>

<p>The store-ship was of more considerable size. Sernigi
(p. 123) says she measured 110 tons; Castanheda credits
her with 200. She may have been a so-called <i>caravela
redonda</i>, that is a caravel which carried square sails on the
main and fore-masts and triangular ones on the mizzen-mast
and the bowsprit. This vessel was purchased of
Ayres Correa, a shipowner of Lisbon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>S. Gabriel</i> and <i>S. Raphael</i> were specially built for
this voyage. Bartholomeu Dias, who superintended their
construction, discarded the caravel in which he himself had
achieved his great success, in favour of square-rigged
vessels of greater burthen, which, although slower sailers
and less able to ply to windward, offered greater safety and
more comfort to their crews. He took care, at the same
time, that the draught of these vessels should enable them
to navigate shallow waters, such as it was expected would
be met with in the course of the voyage. The timber
for these two vessels had been cut during the last year
of the reign of King John, in the Crown woods of Leiria
and Alcacer. The vessels having been completed, the King
ordered them to be equipped by Fernão Lourenço, the
factor of the house of Mines, and one of the most “magnificent”
men of his time.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></p>

<p>No contemporary description or picture of these vessels
has reached us, but there can hardly be a doubt that their
type<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> is fairly represented on a painting made by order of
D. Jorge Cabral, who was Governor of India from 1549
to 1550. This painting subsequently became the property
of D. João de Castro. A copy of it was first published by
the Visconde de Juromenha, who took it from a MS. dated
1558.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> The fine woodcut in W. S. Lindsay’s <i>History of
Merchant Shipping</i> (II, p. 5), from an ancient picture which
also belonged to D. João de Castro, seems to be derived
from the same source, but as the vessel carries the flag of
the Order of Christ at the main, and not the Royal
Standard, it cannot represent the flag-ship. At all events,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>it is not more authentic than either of the ships delineated
in the drawing first published by Juromenha.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption">The supposed Armada of Vasco da Gama.<br />
(<i>From a Painting made by order of Jorge Cabral</i> (1549-50.))<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>Authorities differ very widely as to the tonnage of these
two vessels. Sernigi (see p. <a href="#Page_123">123</a>) says they were of 90 tons
each, thus partly bearing out Correa, who states that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
<i>three</i> ships (including the <i>Berrio</i>) were built of the same
size and pattern.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> D. Pacheco Pereira<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> states that the
largest of them did not exceed 100 tons; J. de Barros
gives them a burthen of between 100 and 120 tons; whilst
Castanheda allocates 120 tons to the flag-ship and 100 to
the <i>S. Raphael</i>.</p>

<p>But whilst the authorities quoted dwell upon the small
size of the vessels which for the first time reached India
from a European port, and even give reasons for this
limitation of burthen,<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> there is some ground for believing
that the tonnage of Vasco da Gama’s ships, expressed
according to modern terminology, was in reality much
greater than is usually supposed. Pedro Barretto de
Rezende (p. 151) may therefore have some justification
when he states that these vessels ranged from 100 to 320
tons. Mr. Lindsay (<i>loc. cit.</i>) would go even further. The
<i>S. Gabriel</i>, according to him, was constructed to carry
400 pipes, equivalent to 400 tons measurement, or about
250 to 300 tons register. He adds that Sr. E. Pinto Bastos
agrees with him.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a></p>

<p>In considering this question of tonnage, it must be borne
in mind that “ton”, at the close of the fifteenth century,
was a different measure from what it is at present. We
learn from E. A. D’Albertis<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> that the <i>tonelada</i> of Seville
was supposed to afford accommodation for two pipes of
27½ arrobas (98 gallons) each, and measured 1.405 cubic
metres, or about 50 cubic feet. The <i>tonel</i> of Biscay was
20 per cent. larger. According to Capt. H. Lopez de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Mendonça, the <i>tonel</i> at Lisbon measured 6 palmos de goa
in length (talha), and 4 such palmos in breadth and height
(parea), that is, about 85 cubic feet.<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> This, however, seems
excessive, for my wine merchant tells me that two butts of
sherry of 108 gallons each would occupy only 75 cubic
feet. At any rate, these data show that the ton of the
fifteenth century was considerably larger than the ton
measurement of the nineteenth.</p>

<p>Two attempts have been made recently by distinguished
officers of the Portuguese Navy, Captains Joào Braz
d’Oliveira<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> and A. A. Baldaque da Silva,<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> to reconstruct
Vasco da Gama’s flagship, or rather to design a ship of a
type existing at the close of the fifteenth century, and
answering as nearly as possible to the scanty indications
to be found within the pages of the historians of this
memorable voyage. In this reconstruction good use has
been made of an early manuscript on shipbuilding by
Fernando Oliveira (<i>O livro da fabrica das Nãos</i>), which
Captain Lopez de Mendonça proposes to publish.</p>

<p>The designs produced by the two naval officers differ
widely in several respects, and more especially as regards
the relation between the total length of the ship and the
breadth of beam. In Captain B. da Silva’s ship the beam
is equal to one-third of the length, whilst the proportion in
Captain J. Braz d’Oliveira’s ship is as one to five. The
former of these ships is broad-beamed, as befits the period,
whilst the latter is almost as slim as a modern clipper. It
must be remembered that, until comparatively recent times,
it was held that the length of a sailing ship should not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>exceed four times the breadth of beam; and this maxim
was undoubtedly acted upon by the shipbuilders of the
fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Captain Baldaque da Silva’s design of the <i>S. Gabriel</i>
has been embodied in a model, and from a photograph of
this model Mr. Herbert Johnson has produced the illustration
placed in front of this Appendix.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the ship designed by Captain
Baldaque da Silvia are as follows:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p class="tb">This, as I learn from a private letter of Captain B. da
Silva, is supposed to be the gross under-deck tonnage, but
on calculating the tonnage according to the Builders’ Old
Measurement Rule, I find it to amount to 230 tons of 40
cubic feet each, whilst the “expeditive” method practised
at Venice<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> during the fifteenth century yields 896 botte of
28 gallons, or about 250 toneladas.</p>

<p>The ship was flat-bottomed, with a square stern and
bluff bow, the latter ornamented with a figure of her
patron saint. Wales were placed along the sides to reduce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
her rolling when going before the wind. Formidable
“castles” rose fore and aft, having a deep waist between
them. These “castles,” however, had not then grown to
the portentous height attained at a subsequent period,
when they rendered it difficult to govern the ship in a
gale, and it often became necessary to cut down the foremast
and dismantle the forecastle to enable them to keep
her head to the wind.</p>

<p>These “castles” were in reality citadels, and enabled
the crew to make a last stand after the vessel had been
boarded. A notable instance of this occurred in the course
of the fight with the <i>Meri</i> in 1502.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a></p>

<p>The captain was lodged in the castle rising upon the
quarter-deck, the officers were accommodated in the room
below his and in the forecastle, whilst the men had their
quarters beneath the gang boards which ran along the top-sides
from castle to castle. The men were each allowed a
locker, to contain such goods as they might obtain by
barter with the natives. Ladders led from the main deck
up to the fighting decks (<i>chapitéo de ré</i> and <i>de vante</i>) of the
two castles, and these were defended against boarders by
nettings. The tiller of the rudder entered the battery
abaft the captain’s apartments, where also stood the
binnacle. The armament consisted of twenty guns. The
lower battery of the “castle” rising on the quarter-deck
was armed with eight breech-loaders made of wrought-iron
staves, held together by hoops and mounted on forked
props. The upper battery held six bombards, and the
forecastle the same number.<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> We may at once state that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>the men carried no firearms. Their arms included cross-bows,
spears, axes, swords, javelins, and boarding-pikes.
Some of the officers were clad in steel armour, whilst the
men had to be content with leather jerkins and breast-plates.</p>

<p>Amidships stood the <i>batel</i>, or long boat, in addition to
which there was available a yawl rowed with four or six
oars.</p>

<p>There were three masts and a bowsprit. The main-mast
rose to a height of 110 ft. above the keel and flew
the Royal Standard at its head, whilst the captain’s scarlet
flag floated from the crow’s-nest, nearly 70 ft. above deck.
A similar crow’s-nest was attached to the foremast. In
the case of an engagement these points of vantage were
occupied by fighting men, who hurled thence javelins,
grenades, and powder-pots upon the enemy. The sails
were square, with the exception of that of the mizzen,
which was triangular. When spread they presented 4,000
square feet of canvas to the wind; this was exclusive of
the “bonnets” which were occasionally laced to the leeches
of the mainsail, and served to some extent the same
purpose as a modern studding-sail.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> The Cross of the
Order of Christ was painted on each sail.</p>

<p>The anchors, two in number, were of iron, with a wooden
stock and a ring for bending the cable.</p>

<p>The hold was divided into three compartments. Amidships
were the water barrels, with coils of cable on the top
of them&mdash;a very inconvenient arrangement; abaft was the
powder-magazine, and most arms and munitions, including
iron and stone balls, were kept there; the forward compartment
was used for the storage of requisites, including
spare sails and a spare anchor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<p>The lower deck was divided by bulkheads into three
compartments, two of which were set apart for provisions,
presents, and articles of barter. The “provisions”, according
to Castanheda, were calculated to suffice for three years,
and the daily rations were on a liberal scale, consisting
of 1½ pounds of biscuit, 1 pound of beef or half a
pound of pork, 2½ pints of water, 1¼ pints of wine, one-third
of a gill of vinegar, and half that quantity of oil. On
fast days, half a pound of rice, of codfish, or cheese was
substituted for the meat. There were, in addition, flour,
lentils, sardines, plums, almonds, onions, garlic, mustard,
salt, sugar and honey. These ships’ stores were supplemented
by fish, caught whenever an opportunity offered,
and by fresh provisions obtained when in port, among
which were oranges, which proved most acceptable to the
many men suffering from scurvy.</p>

<p>The merchandise was not only insufficient in quantity,
but proved altogether unsuited to the Indian market. It
seems to have included <i>lambel</i> (striped cotton stuff), sugar,
olive-oil, honey, and coral beads. Among the objects
intended for presents, there were wash-hand basins, scarlet
hoods, silk jackets, pantaloons, hats, Moorish caps; besides
such trifles as glass beads, little round bells, tin rings and
bracelets, which were well enough suited for barter on the
Guinea coast, but were not appreciated by the wealthy
merchants of Calecut. Of ready money there seems to
have been little to spare. All this is made evident by the
letters of D. Manuel and Signor Sernigi.</p>

<p>The scientific outfit of the expedition, it may safely be
presumed, was the best to be procured at the time. The
learned D. Diogo Ortiz de Vilhegas<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> furnished Da Gama
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>with maps and books, including, almost as a matter of
course, a copy of Ptolemy, and copies of the information
on the East collected at Lisbon for years past. Among
these reports, that sent home by Pero de Covilhão found,
no doubt, a place,<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> as also the information furnished by
Lucas Marcos,<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> an Abyssinian priest who visited Lisbon
about 1490.</p>

<p>The astronomical instruments were provided by Zacut,
the astronomer, and it is even stated that Vasco enjoyed
the advantage of being trained as a practical observer by
that learned Hebrew. These instruments included a large
wooden astrolabe, smaller astrolabes of metal, and, in all
probability, also quadrants; and they were accompanied
by a copy of Zacut’s <i>Almanach perpetuum Celestium
motuum cujus radix est 1473</i>, a translation of which, by
José Vizinho, had been printed at Leiria in 1496.<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>tables enabled the navigator to calculate his latitudes by
observing the altitude of the sun.</p>

<p>There was, of course, a sufficient supply of compasses, of
sounding leads and hour-glasses, and possibly also a
<i>catena a poppa</i>, that is, a rope towed at the stern to
determine the ship’s leeway, and a <i>toleta de marteloia</i>, a
graphical substitute for our modern traverse tables, both
of them contrivances long since in use among the Italians.
It is also possible that Vasco was already provided with an
equinoctial compass for determining the time of high
water at the ports he visited, and with a variation compass.
This instrument consisted of a combination of a sun-dial
with a magnetic needle. It had been invented by Peurbach,
<i>c.</i> 1460, was improved by Felipe Guillen, 1528, and by
Pedro Nunes, 1537, and used for the first time on an
extensive scale by João de Castro, during a voyage to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>India and the Red Sea, in 1538-41.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> We are inclined to
think that Vasco had such a variation compass, for the
Cabo das Agulhas, or “Needle Cape”, thus named because
the needle there pointed, or was supposed to point,
due north, has already found a place on Cantino’s Chart,
and can have been named only as the result of an actual
observation, however inaccurate.</p>

<span class="caption">Cão’s Padrão at Cape
Cross.</span></span>
Lastly, there remain to be noticed the
Padrãos, or pillars of stone which were
on board the vessels, and three of which,
by the king’s express desire, were dedicated
to S. Raphael, S. Gabriel, and S.
Maria (see p. <a href="#Page_80">80</a>). Barros and Castanheda
tell us that these pillars resembled
those set up by Cão and Dias in the
time of D. João II; and in a series of
pictures which D. Manuel desired to
have painted in celebration of the discovery
of India, the Padrão to be shown
at the Cape of Good Hope, or “Prasum
promontorium”, was to have been surmounted
by a cross, and to bear the
Royal Arms and a Pelican, with an inscription giving
the date.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a></p>

<p>Correa, on the other hand, affirms in his <i>Lendas</i> that the
pillar set up at the Rio da Misericordia (the Rio dos Bons
Signaes of the <i>Roteiro</i>) was of marble, with two escutcheons,
one of the arms of Portugal, and the other (at the back) of
a sphere, and that the inscription was “Do senhorio de
Portugal reino de Christãos”. The pillar at Melinde had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>the same escutcheons, but the inscription was limited to
the words “Rey Manoel”.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> As Correa had an opportunity
of seeing these pillars, his description of them may be
correct, though he is an arrant fabulator.</p>

<h3>MUSTER-ROLL OF VASCO DA GAMA’S FLEET.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> officers and men in Vasco da Gama’s <i>armada</i> were
carefully selected. Several of them had been with
Bartholomeu Dias round the Cape; all of them, as appears
from this “Journal”, justified by their conduct under sometimes
trying circumstances the selection which had been
made.</p>

<p>Authorities widely differ as to the number of men who
embarked. Sernigi (p. 124) says there were only 118, of
whom 55 died during the voyage and only 63 returned.
Galvão says there were 120, besides the men in the store-ship.
Castanheda and Goes raise the number to 148, of
whom only 55 returned, many of them broken in health.
Faria y Sousa and San Ramon say there were 160, and
the latter adds that 93 of these died during the voyage,
thus confirming a statement made by King Manuel in his
letter of February 20th, 1504, to the effect that less than
one-half returned.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> According to Barros there were 170
men, including soldiers and sailors. Correa raises the
number to 260, for he says that in each of the three ships
there were 80 officers and men, including servants, besides
six convicts and two priests.<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> He says nothing of the
store-ship. By the time Vasco da Gama had reached the
Rio da Misericordia only 150 out of this number are said
to have been alive.</p>

<p>Correa, no doubt, exaggerates. On the other hand,
Sernigi’s numbers seem to us to err quite as much on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>other side. It is quite true that a Mediterranean merchantman
of 100 tons, in the sixteenth century, was manned
by 12 able and 8 ordinary seamen;<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> but in the case of an
expedition sent forth for a number of years and to unknown
dangers, this number would no doubt have been increased.
We are, therefore, inclined to believe that the number
given by De Barros&mdash;namely, 170&mdash;may be nearer the
truth, namely 70 men in the flag-ship, 50 in the <i>S. Raphael</i>,
30 in the caravel, and 20 in the store-ship. The men in
the flag-ship may have included 1 captain, 1 master, 1 pilot,
1 assistant pilot, 1 mate (contramestre), 1 boatswain
(guardião), 20 able seamen (marinheiros), 10 ordinary
seamen (grumetes), 2 boys (pagens), 1 chief gunner or
constable, 8 bombardiers, 4 trumpeters, 1 clerk or purser
(escrivão), 1 storekeeper (dispenseiro), 1 officer of justice
(meirinho), 1 barber-surgeon, 2 interpreters, 1 chaplain,
6 artificers (ropemaker, carpenter, calker, cooper, armourer
and cook), and 10 servants. One or more of these servants
may have been negro slaves. The “Degradados”, or
convicts on board, to be “adventured on land” (p. 48), are
included in the total. Whether private gentlemen were
permitted to join this expedition as volunteers history
doth not record.</p>

<p>The following “muster-roll” contains short notices of
all those who are stated to have embarked at Lisbon in
Vasco da Gama’s fleet, or who subsequently joined it,
either voluntarily or upon compulsion.</p>

<p>Apart from natives, thirty-one persons are mentioned, and
with respect to twenty-six of these no reasonable doubt
can be entertained that they were actually members of the
ships’ companies.</p>

<p>On February 24, 1500, the King granted him a pension of
70,000 reis. He also received a coat-of-arms, viz.: a field <i>gules</i>,
charged with a lion rampant between two pillars (<i>padrãos</i>), <i>silver</i>,
standing upon hillocks by the sea <i>vert</i>; and two small escutcheons
charged with five <i>bezants</i> (Severim de Faria, <i>Noticias de Portugal</i>,
Disc. 3, § 15). He seems to have been dead in 1522, for on
December 19 of that year, his son, Francisco, begged the King to
transfer the pension of his late father to himself.&mdash;(Cunha Rivara,

<p><i>Gonçalo Nunes</i>, Captain of the store-ship (Barros, I, pt. 1, p. 279;

He had been with Dias in the discovery of the Cape of Good
Hope, and with the Congo mission in 1490.</p>

<p>* <i>João de Coimbra</i>, pilot of the <i>S. Raphael</i> (Barros, I, pt. 1,

<p><i>Pero Escolar</i>, pilot of the <i>Berrio</i> (Barros, <i>ib.</i>; Faria y Sousa,
p. 29). On February 18, 1500, the King granted him a pension
of 4,000 reis. He went as pilot with Cabral.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>
<p><i>Gonçalo Alvares</i>, master of the <i>S. Gabriel</i> (Barros, <i>ib.</i>). He
subsequently held the office of pilot-major of India (Correa,
<i>Lendas</i>, I, p. 570). On January 26, 1504, the King granted
him a pension of 6,000 reis (Texeira de Aragão, <i>Boletim</i>, 1886,
p. 674).</p>

<p><i>André Gonçalves.</i> According to Correa (<i>Lendas</i>, I, p. 148), he
had been with Vasco da Gama, whose interest had procured him
an appointment in Cabral’s fleet. The same untrustworthy author
states (p. 152) that Cabral sent him back from Brazil with the
news of his discovery, and that the King, immediately after his
arrival, fitted out a fleet to continue the explorations in the New
World. Barros (I, pt. 1, p. 384) and Castanheda (I, p. 97) state
that Cabral sent back Gaspar de Lemos. Neither they, nor, as
far as I am aware, any other authority, mention an André
Gonçalves in connection with Gama’s or Cabral’s expeditions.</p>

<p class="center padt1"><span class="smcap">Pursers or Clerks.</span></p>

<p>* <i>Diogo Dias</i>, clerk of the <i>S. Gabriel</i> (Barros, I, pt. 1, p. 279;
Castanheda, I, pp. 54, 80; Goes, I, p. 90; Faria y Sousa, I,
p. 29). He was a brother of Bartholomeu Dias, the discoverer
of the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p><i>João de Sá</i>, clerk of the <i>S. Raphael</i> (Barros, I, pt. 1, p. 370;
Castanheda, Goes, Faria y Sousa). He again went to India with
Cabral (Barros, I, pt. 1, p. 403), and subsequently became
treasurer of the India House (Castanheda, I, p. 54).</p>

<p><i>Alvaro de Braga</i>, clerk of the <i>Berrio</i> (Barros, Castanheda,
Goes). Vasco appointed him head of the factory at Calecut.
Correa (<i>Lendas</i>, I, pp. 89-91) erroneously calls him Pedro de
Braga. He was rewarded by the King, February 1, 1501
(<i>Boletim</i>, 1886, p. 675).</p>

<p class="center padt1"><span class="smcap">Interpreters.</span></p>

<p>* <i>Martim Affonso</i> (Barros, I, pt. 1, p. 289; Castanheda, I,
p. 15; Goes, I, p. 74; Faria y Sousa, p. 29). He had lived
in Congo.</p>

<p><i>Fernão Martins</i> (Barros, I, pt. 1, p. 290; Castanheda, I,
pp. 51, 54; Goes, I, p. 89). Vasco sent him to the King of
Calecut, and he was present at the audience which Vasco had of
the King (Goes, I, p. 95). Subsequently he filled several
positions of trust in India. He is the “African slave” who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
spoke Arabic, referred to by Correa (Stanley’s <i>Vasco da Gama</i>,
pp. 76, 203).</p>

<p><i>João Martins</i>, see João Nunez, <i>infra</i>.</p>

<p class="center padt1"><span class="smcap">Priests.</span></p>

<p><i>Pedro de Covilhã</i>, called Pero de Cobillones by Faria y Sousa
(I, p. 29), who refers to ancient documents and the assertion of
F. Christoval Osorio, of the Order of Trinity, as his authorities.
He was Prior of a monastery of the Order of the Trinity at Lisbon,
and went out as Chaplain of the Fleet and Father Confessor.
According to Francisco de Sousa’s <i>Oriente Conquistado</i>, I, p. 477,
he died a martyr on July 7, 1498, and this statement is accepted
by P. Francisco de S. Maria (<i>Anno historico</i>, II, Lisbon, 1794,
p. 323). Fr. Jeronymo de São Jose (<i>Historia chronologica da
Ordem da S. Trindade</i>, Lisbon, 1789-94) enlarges upon this
by stating that this apocryphal “protomartyr” of India “was
speared whilst expounding the doctrines of the Trinity”. At the
date of his alleged death, Vasco da Gama was still at Calecut.
He may have died of disease. Neither Barros, Castanheda, nor
Correa mentions the name of this priest.</p>

<p><i>João Figueiro.</i> Correa claims to have derived much information
from a diary kept by this priest, of which only fragments
appear to have come into his possession. Other authors ignore
the name (see Stanley’s <i>Vasco da Gama</i>, pp. ii, vi, 260).</p>

<p class="center padt1"><span class="smcap">Sailors and Soldiers.</span></p>

<p><i>João d’Ameixoeira</i> or <i>Dameiroeiro</i>. According to Correa
(I, p. 136), he was one of the mutineers who returned to Portugal.
No other writer mentions him.</p>

<p><i>Pedro de Faria e Figueiredo</i>, died at Cabo das Correntes (Faria
y Sousa, I, p. 29).</p>

<p><i>Francisco de Faria e Figueiredo</i>, brother of the preceding. He
wrote Latin verses. He, too, died at Cabo das Correntes (Faria
y Sousa, I, p. 29).</p>

<p>* <i>Sancho Mexia</i>, incidentally mentioned in the <i>Roteiro</i>
(see p. <a href="#Page_6">6</a>).</p>

<p><i>João Palha</i>, one of the thirteen who attended Vasco da Gama
to Calecut (Correa, I, p. 96).</p>

<p><i>Gonçalo Pirez</i>, a mariner and retainer of Vasco da Gama
(Castanheda, I, p. 54). On May 31, 1497, he had been ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>pointed
master of a caravel recently built at Oporto (Texeira de
Aragão, <i>Boletim</i>, 1886, p. 563).</p>

<p><i>Leonardo Ribeyro.</i> According to Manuel Correa’s commentary
on the <i>Obras do grande Camões</i>, Lisbon, 1720, this, on the
authority of the poet himself, is the full name of the “Leonardo”
mentioned in Canto <span class="smcap">VI</span>, stanza 40. Faria y Sousa (<i>Asia Portuguesa</i>,
I, p. 29) identified this “Leonardo” with Francisco de
Faria e Figueredo, but subsequently (<i>Commentos aos Lusiadas</i>,
1639) he gave up the point.</p>

<p><i>João de Setubal</i>, according to Correa (I, pp. 96, 104, 107), was
one of the thirteen who accompanied Vasco da Gama to Calecut
(see Stanley’s <i>Vasco da Gama</i>, pp. 119, 213).</p>

<p><i>Alvaro Velho</i>, a soldier (Castanheda, I, p. 54; Goes, I, p. 90;
Faria y Sousa). Perhaps this is the Alvaro Velho de Barreyro
mentioned by Valentin Ferdinand (Valentino de Moravia or
Alemão), in his <i>Description of Africa</i> (1507), as having resided
eight years at Sierra Leone (see Kunstmann, in <i>Abhdlgn. d. bayer.
Ak. d. W., Cl. iij</i>, t. IX, Abt. 1).</p>

<p>* <i>Fernão Veloso</i>, a soldier (Barros, I, pt. 1, p. 283-6; Castanheda,
I, p. 9; Goes, I, p. 71; Faria y Sousa; Camoens, Canto <span class="smcap">VI</span>,
stanza 41).</p>

<p class="center padt1"><span class="smcap">Convicts or Banished Men (Degradados).</span></p>

<p><i>Pedro Dias</i>, nicknamed “Northeasterling”. Correa (<i>Lendas</i>,
I, p. 46) says that Vasco da Gama left him behind at Moçambique,
and that subsequently he came to India (compare Stanley’s
<i>Vasco da Gama</i>, p. 106).</p>

<p><i>Pero Esteves.</i> Correa (<i>Lendas</i>, I, p. 236) says that Vasco da
Gama left him behind at Quiloa, and that when J. da Nova
reached that port in 1501, he came out to meet him. Barros
(I, pt. 1, p. 467) says that the convict who met J. da Nova had
been landed by Cabral, and that his name was Antonio Fernandez.</p>

<p><i>João Machado</i>, according to Correa (<i>Lendas</i>, I, pp. 41, 160),
was left behind by Vasco da Gama at Moçambique, but according
to Barros (I, pt. 1, p. 406) it was Cabral who left him at Melinde,
with instructions to make inquiries about Prester John. Cabral
may have transferred him from Moçambique to the more
northern port. He subsequently did good service, and Affonso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
de Albuquerque appointed him alcaide mór of Goa. He was
slain in battle, 1515 (see Stanley’s <i>Vasco da Gama</i>, pp. 93-5).</p>

<p><i>Damião Rodriguez</i> was a friend of João Machado, and a
seaman on board the <i>S. Gabriel</i>, from which vessel he deserted
at the shoals of S. Raphael. When Cabral came to Moçambique,
his grave was pointed out. All this is stated on the sole authority
of Correa (<i>Lendas</i>, I, p. 160). Compare Stanley’s <i>Vasco da
Gama</i>, p. 94.</p>

<p><i>João Nunez</i>, a “new” Christian (<i>i.e.</i>, a converted Jew), who
knew a little Arabic and Hebrew, and was landed at Calecut.
In the Portuguese edition of Correa (I, p. 78) he is erroneously
called João Martins (see Stanley’s <i>Vasco da Gama</i>, pp. 159,
180, 206).</p>

<p class="center padt1"><span class="smcap">Natives and others Embarked in the East.</span></p>

<p>* <i>Gaspar da Gama.</i> This is the “Moor”, or renegade, who
joined Vasco da Gama at Anjediva Island. Our anonymous
author describes him as about forty years of age, and as being
able to speak “Venetian” well. He claimed to have come to
India in early youth, and was at the time in the service of the
Governor of Goa. Vasco da Gama carried him to Portugal,
where he was baptized and received the name of Gaspar da
Gama. In the <i>Commentaries of Afonso Dalboquerque</i> (Hakluyt
Society, 1884) he is frequently referred to as Gaspar da India.
Correa (<i>Lendas da India</i>) usually refers to him as Gaspar da
Gama, but also calls him Gaspar de las Indias, or Gaspar
d’Almeida. King Manuel, in his letter to the Cardinal Protector,
calls him a “Jew, who turned Christian, a merchant and
lapidary”. Sernigi (see p. <a href="#Page_136">136</a>) held a conversation with him
at Lisbon. He speaks of him as a Sclavonian Jew, born at
Alexandria.</p>

<p>According to the information given by Barros and Goes, the
parents of Gaspar fled from Posen, in Poland, at the time when
King Casimir cruelly persecuted the Jews (about 1456). After
a short residence in Palestine they removed to Alexandria,
where Gaspar was born (Barros, I, pt. 1, pp. 364-5; Goes, pt. 1,
c. 44).</p>

<p>He accompanied Cabral as interpreter. Vespucci met him on
his homeward voyage at Cape Verde, and in his letter of June 4,
1501, published by Baldelli (<i>Il Milione</i>, 1827), he speaks highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
of Gaspar’s linguistic attainments, and refers to his extensive
travels in Asia.</p>

<p>Gaspar repeatedly accompanied Portuguese expeditions to
India, and was last heard of in 1510. Goes (<i>loc. cit.</i>) says that
King Manuel liked him, and appointed him a cavalier of his
household.</p>

<p>Correa (Stanley’s <i>Vasco da Gama</i>, p. 247) describes this Gaspar
as a Jew, who, “at the taking of Granada was a very young man;
and who, having been driven from his country, passed through
many lands ... on to India”. But, as Granada was only taken
in 1492, this is absurd.</p>

<p>Lunardo da Chá Masser, who came to Lisbon in 1504 as
ambassador of the Signoria, in a letter written about 1506
and first published in the <i>Archivio Storico Italiano</i> (Florence,
1846), says that Gaspar married a Portuguese lady,<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> and was
granted a pension of 170 ducats annually, in recognition of the
valuable information which he furnished respecting the Oriental
trade.</p>

<p>* <i>Monçaide</i>, who came on board Vasco da Gama’s vessel at
Calecut, is stated by Barros (I, pt. 1, pp. 330 <i>et seq.</i>) and Goes
(I, p. 98) to have been a native of Tunis, who, in the time of
King John II had done business with the Portuguese at Oran,
and spoke Castilian. He accompanied Vasco da Gama to
Portugal and was baptised. In King Manuel’s letter to the
Cardinal Protector he is referred to as a “Moor of Tunis”. The
author of the <i>Roteiro</i> calls him a “Moor of Tunis” whom the
Moors of Calecut suspected of being a Christian and emissary of
the King of Portugal (p. 75).</p>

<p>Correa (Stanley’s <i>Vasco da Gama</i>, pp. 162-5, 221) says that he
was a native of Seville, who, having been captured when five
years old, turned Moslem, although “in his soul he was still a
Christian”. He generally refers to this man as “the Castilian”,
and says that his true name was Alonso Perez.</p>

<p>Castanheda (I, p. 50) tells us that the Portuguese corrupted
Monçaide into Bontaibo, a combination of the Portuguese <i>bom</i>,
“good”, and the Arabic <i>tayyib</i>, having the same meaning. Monçaide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
is probably a corruption of El Masud, the “happy-one”
(Burton’s <i>Camoens</i>, iv, p. 432).</p>

<p>* <i>Malemo Canaqua</i>, or <i>Cana</i>, the pilot who guided Vasco da
Gama from Melinde to Calecut. He was a native of Gujarat
(Barros, I, pt. 1, pp. 319, 328, 330; Goes, I, c. 38; Castanheda,
I, p. 41). Malemo stands for “muallim” or “mallim”,
“master” or “teacher”, the usual native designation of the
skipper of a vessel, whilst “Kanaka” designates the pilot’s caste.</p>

<p><i>Davane</i>, of Cambay, said to have been taken out of a dhau to
the south of Moçambique, to have agreed to accompany Vasco da
Gama to Calecut as broker, and to have been ultimately discharged
with good testimonials in November 1498 at Cananor, is only
mentioned by Correa (Stanley’s <i>Vasco da Gama</i>, pp. 79, 84, 113,
128, 235). No other historian knows anything about this
mythical personage.</p>

<p>* <i>Baltasar</i>, and the four other Moors, forcibly carried away
from Calecut (see pp. 73, 75, and 79, and King Manuel’s letter
to the Cardinal Protector, p. 115) were taken back by Cabral, as
was also the Ambassador of the King of Melinde (<i>Alguns Documentos
do Archivo nacional</i>, 1892, p. 97).</p>

<p>Vasco da Gama originally detained eighteen “Moors”. He
is stated in the “Journal” to have subsequently liberated six, and
to have sent one with a letter to the Zamorin. This would leave
eleven, not five. The number of those liberated must, therefore,
have been twelve, and not six.</p></blockquote>

<h3>THE VOYAGE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> King was at Montemór o novo<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> when he despatched
Vasco da Gama and his fellow-commanders upon the
momentous expedition which was to place Portugal for a
time in the forefront of maritime and commercial powers.
It was summer, and His Majesty did not, therefore, desert
the beautiful hills of Monfurado for the stifling heat of the
capital, in order that he might witness the embarkation
of his “loyal vassal” whom, on account of his proved
valour and past services he had deemed worthy of the
honourable distinction of being entrusted with the conduct
of so important an enterprise.<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> Vasco da Gama and his
officers, the night before their departure, kept vigil in the
chapel of Our Lady of Belem, which was not then a stately
pile such as that which now occupies the site of the original
unostentatious <i>ermida</i> founded by Prince Henry for the
convenience of mariners.</p>

<p>On the following morning, which was Saturday, the 8th
of July, 1497,<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> Vasco da Gama and his companions were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>escorted to the beach by a procession of priests and friars.
They all carried lighted tapers, and an excited crowd
muttered responses to the litany which was being intoned
by the priests. On reaching the place of embarkation,
the vicar of the chapel celebrated mass and received a
general confession; after which, in virtue of a Bull published
by Pope Nicholas V in 1452, he absolved the
departing adventurers of their sins. And thus they left
on their errand with the blessings of the Church, in the
favour of their King, and amidst the acclamations of a
sympathising people.</p>

<p class="center padt1"><i>Lisbon to the Cape Verde Islands.</i></p>

<p>Winds and currents being favourable, the voyage to the
Cape Verde Islands was accomplished in good time, and
the flag-ship, notwithstanding some delay caused by a
dense fog on the Saharan coast, reached the Ilha do Sal,
1,590 miles from Lisbon, in the course of fourteen days, if
not earlier, and on July 27th the little armada lay snugly
in the harbour of São Thiago.</p>

<p class="center padt1"><i>The Voyage across the Southern Atlantic.</i></p>

<p>The accounts of Vasco da Gama’s remarkable voyage
across the Southern Atlantic are of so scanty a nature
that it is quite impossible to lay down his track with
certainty. What we learn from the “Journal” may be
condensed into a few words. The little armada left São
Thiago on August 3rd, <i>going east</i>! On the 18th of that
month, when 200 leagues (680 miles) out at sea, the main-yard
of the flagship sprung in a squall, and this necessitated
laying to for a couple of days and a night. On the 22nd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>of October,<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> when 800 leagues (2,700 miles) out at sea,
going S. by W.,<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> large birds were seen flying to the
S.S.E. as if making for the land, as also a whale.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> On
October 27th more whales were seen, besides seals. On
November 4th, at 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, the main land was sighted, probably
about 150 miles to the north of St. Helena Bay
(30° S.).</p>

<p>In these days of hydrographic offices and sailing
directories we know how a sailing vessel desirous of proceeding
from the Cape Verde Islands to the Cape would
shape her course. She would endeavour to cross the
equator about long. 22° W., pass to the leeward of Trinidad
Island (20° S.), and then, gradually gaining a higher
latitude, trust to the “brave” westerly winds carrying her
beyond Tristão da Cunha to the Cape, or beyond.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a></p>

<p>But Vasco da Gama had none of this information to
guide him in shaping his course. He was informed, as a
matter of course, about the winds and currents prevailing
off the Guinea coast, but of what might be experienced in
the open sea beyond he knew nothing.</p>

<p>It is just possible that he may have considered the
possibility of reaching the Cape by a direct course of
3,770 miles, and he may even have attempted to carry out
such a scheme. In the end, however, he would never have
been able to work down against the strong S.E. “trades”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>and northern currents, for his ships could not be laid
nearer than six points to the wind, and even then they
would have made considerable leeway.</p>

<p>His actual course, in any case, must have been a circuitous
one, and we may suppose it to have been as
follows:&mdash;Having left São Thiago in an easterly direction,<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a>
he kept in the direction of the coast for a considerable distance,
but when he came within the influence of the dreaded
<i>doldrums</i> he met with unpleasant weather in the shape of
calms, baffling winds, and squalls, which prevail more
especially during the months of June, July, and August.
One of these squalls sprung the mainyard of the flagship,
and heaving up a new yard necessitated a delay of two
days and a night. When attempting to make southing
he was driven to the westward, but managed to cross
the equator in about 19° west.</p>

<p>Thence he followed a circuitous course, which brought
him within 600 miles of the coast of Brazil. The northern
part of this assumed course lies to the west of a track
recommended by Captain Horsburgh as being most
favourable for vessels proceeding between April and
October from the Cape Verdes to St. Helena, whilst its
southern part lies to the west of the usual track of sailing
vessels going from Ascension to the Cape. In this manner
we suppose Vasco da Gama to have reached lat. 30° S.
long. 15° W., by October 22nd. This point lies about 800
leagues, or 2,700 miles, in a direct line from São Thiago;
but by the track assumed by us the distance is 1,030
leagues, or 3,480 miles. As Vasco da Gama spent eighty
days in making this distance, including the time lost in
repairing his yard, his daily run only amounted to 44 miles.</p>

<p>It was here that Vasco da Gama saw birds flying to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>S.S.E. They were no doubt making for Tristão da
Cunha, which lies at a distance of about 400 miles in that
direction. He also saw a whale, a very common sight in
these latitudes.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a></p>

<p>Thus far the course followed had been more or less
southerly, but Vasco da Gama had now passed beyond the
S.E. “trades”, and found himself under the welcome influence
of “brave” west winds and of an eastern current, running
at the rate of a knot in the hour. This speeded him on
his course, and he covered the 500 leagues, or 1,700 miles,
which still separated him from the west coast of Africa,
in the course of thirteen days, making his first landfall
on November 4th in about 30° S. His average daily
run on this course must, therefore, have amounted to 131
miles.<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a></p>

<p>This may seem a high rate, but it is by no means an
exceptional one. Vasco himself made at least 114 miles
daily during his passage from Lisbon to the Cape Verdes,
and 125 between the Cape and the Guinea coast when
homeward bound. Columbus, during his first voyage,
averaged 84 miles<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> daily between Gomera and Guanahani,
but on nine days his daily run exceeded 150 miles, and on
one day&mdash;the 4th of September&mdash;he actually covered 210
miles, although he had to take into account the bad sailing
qualities of one of his vessels, the <i>Niña</i>.</p>

<p>We have laid down Vasco da Gama’s hypothetical
track with a considerable amount of diffidence. The
passage might, of course, have been effected in various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>other ways.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> When Cabral started for India in 1500 he
was instructed by Vasco da Gama himself to sail southward
from the Cape Verde Islands, until he should have
reached the latitude of the Cape, and then to head to the
east. Cabral, however, was carried by winds and currents
towards Brazil, which he made in lat. 17° 20´ S., and
thence followed a track which took him past Trinidad
and Fernão Vaz,<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> and does not differ much from that
now recommended to sailing vessels.</p>

<p>João da Nova, who left for India in March 1501, did not
follow the route of his predecessor, perhaps on account of
the terrible disaster which overtook Cabral when in the
vicinity of Tristão da Cunha. Nova seems to have
attempted a direct passage; for following perhaps the
eastern route recommended to a later generation by
Laurie’s <i>Sailing Directory for the Ethiopic Ocean</i> (4th
edition, by A. G. Finlay, p. 74), he discovered the island
of Ascension on the outward voyage, and is generally
credited with having reached the Cape without coming
within sight of the coast of Brazil.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p>Vasco da Gama, during his second voyage in 1502, seems
to have seen no land from the time he left Cape Verde
until he arrived at Sofala, that is, during ninety-nine days,
viz., from March 7th to June 14th: a remarkably quick
passage. He seems on that occasion to have given the
Cape of Good Hope a wide berth.</p>

<p>His nephew, Estevão da Gama, who left Lisbon on
April 1st, took the western route. He passed the Cape
Verde Islands on April 15th, Trinidad,<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> in the Southern
Atlantic, on May 18th, doubled the Cape about the beginning
of June, and first made land, on July 11th, at the
Cabo Primeiro, on the coast of Natal, one hundred and
two days after his departure from Lisbon.</p>

<p>When Affonso de Albuquerque reached Cape Verde on
his voyage to India, in 1503, he took counsel with his pilots
whether to follow the “usual route” along the coast of
Africa, or to make boldly for mid-ocean. The latter
course was decided upon. After a voyage of twenty-eight
days, the Island of Ascension<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> was reached, at an estimated
distance of 750 to 800 leagues from the Cape. Subsequently
de Albuquerque touched the coast of Brazil, and then stood
across the Atlantic for the Cape of Good Hope, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>he made on July 6th, having thus accomplished the passage
from Lisbon in the course of ninety-one days.</p>

<p>Duarte Pacheco, who wrote his <i>Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis</i>
in 1505, recommends vessels to go south from Cape
Verde for 600 leagues, to lat. 19° S., and thence to make
for a point 40 leagues to the S.W. of the Cape of Good
Hope, in lat. 37° S. Such a course would take a vessel to
the windward of Trinidad.</p>

<p>These notes prove that the Portuguese, in the course of
a few years, must have acquired a remarkably correct
knowledge of the winds and currents of the Southern
Atlantic; for the tracks laid down and followed by their
pilots in the beginning of the sixteenth century differ
but little, if at all, from those recommended in our modern
sailing directories.</p>

<p class="center padt1"><i>Doubling the Cape</i>.</p>

<p>Three days after his landfall we find Vasco da Gama
in the Bay of St. Helena, where he careened his ships,
took in a fresh supply of water, and observed the latitude.<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a></p>

<p>He left this anchorage on November 16th. Two days
afterwards he sighted the Cape, but the wind being from
the S.S.W. he was obliged to stand off and on until the
22nd, when he succeeded in getting beyond it “without
encountering the storms and perils expected by the
mariners”; and following the coast he cast anchor in the
Bay of S. Braz on the 25th, and there set up his
first padrão. In that run he must have been favoured
by the wind, which along the coast and in November blows
generally from the S.E., although westerly winds and
even gales are not infrequent.</p>

<p>Barros, Castanheda, and Goes give the same account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>the doubling of the Cape, but Correa would have us believe
that Vasco da Gama, after having made a landfall to the
north of the Cape, stood out for the open sea for a month,
until there were scarcely six hours of sunlight in the day;
and that, even after that, and after he had once more failed
to reach the southern extremity of Africa, he continued south
for two more months. Then at last he turned again to the
east, and found that he had doubled the Cape. Beyond it
he discovered lofty mountains and many rivers, one of
which was ascended by Coelho for twenty leagues.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> The
utter absurdity of this account is evident, and it is surprising
that it should have been accepted by serious historians.
A day of six hours may be experienced in lat. 58° 30´ S. in
mid-winter&mdash;that is in June&mdash;but nowhere in the southern
hemisphere during summer. In November the duration of
daylight in that latitude is about sixteen hours, and to talk
about “darkness” under these circumstances seems absurd.
It would, moreover, have been impossible to reach so high
a latitude without coming amidst masses of drift-ice, which
surely would have proved a stranger experience to Vasco’s
companions than “tremendous seas” and “high winds”,
and better worth recording.</p>

<p class="center padt1"><i>Along the East Coast of Africa.</i></p>

<p>On December 8th Vasco left the Bay of S. Braz, and
four days afterwards experienced a heavy westerly gale
(p. 18).</p>

<p>Barros, Goes, and Castanheda refer to this gale, but
Correa, not content with a gale, conjures up a succession
of storms, continuing for days, so that the crews clamoured
to be taken back to Portugal. The men in Coelho’s ships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>are actually said to have conspired to mutiny at the earliest
opportunity. Their intention, we are expected to believe,
was made known to the captain-major by a mysteriously-worded
message shouted from ship to ship by Coelho.
Vasco at once summoned his people, declared to them that
“if the bad weather came again he had determined to
put back; but to disculpate himself with the King it was
necessary for some among them to sign a document giving
the reasons for putting back.” Having invited on this
pretence his pilot, his master and three leading seamen
into his cabin, he treacherously put them in irons, and,
flinging all the instruments necessary for navigating the
ship into the sea, declared that God would henceforth be
their master and pilot. The men were released on reaching
the River of Mercy, but on their return to Portugal they
were ironed once more, to be presented in that degrading
state to their King!<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a></p>

<p>Osorio<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> likewise gives an account of a mutiny, but says
that it occurred before the Cape was doubled. He differs
in other respects from Correa, stating, for instance, that
“<i>all</i> the pilots were put in chains.” As Osorio’s book was
published in 1571, whilst Correa’s MS., although written
in 1561, only reached Lisbon in 1583, it is not probable
that the former borrowed from the latter. They may both
have derived their information from the same impure
source, and accepted an idle tradition as the record of a
fact. That there may have been some discontent among
the men is quite possible, but we cannot believe that the
pilots intended to head a mutiny. We quite agree with
Professor Kopke,<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> when he prefers the authority of Barros,
Goes, and Castanheda, and of the author of this “Journal”,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>to that of Osorio. This applies with still greater force to
the absurdly elaborate account of Correa. Professor A.
Herculano, in the second edition of the <i>Roteiro</i> (p. viii),
discredits Professor Kopke’s notes on the insufficient
ground that the eminent authorities referred to above
refrained from every allusion to a mutiny from a “fear of
tarnishing the fame of Vasco da Gama’s companions.”
But Herculano believed in Correa&mdash;we do not.</p>

<p>Early on December 15th, Vasco once more made for the
land, and found himself abreast, the Ilhéos Chãos (Bird
islands) in Algoa Bay, having thus covered only a couple of
hundred miles in the course of seven days. Fair progress
was made for a couple of days after this. The vessels
kept near the coast, and being favoured by the wind, and
also by an inshore counter-current, were able to pass
beyond the pillar set up by Dias and the furthest point
reached by that navigator. But on December 17th the
wind sprang round to the east. Vasco da Gama stood out
to sea, and was thus made to experience the full force
of the Agulhas current, which here runs at a distance
of about ten miles from the land. He was unable to make
head against the combined forces of wind and current,
and when, on December 20th, he again approached the
land he found himself at the Ilhéo da Cruz, 27 miles to the
westward of the group of islets from which he had started
on the 15th (see p. <a href="#Page_15">15</a>).</p>

<p>Henceforth, for a number of days, the wind proved
propitious, and by December 25th our voyagers, clinging
all the while to the coast, had proceeded 240 miles beyond
the furthest point reached by Dias (as estimated by the
pilots); and three days afterwards they cast anchor and
took a quantity of fish. This locality we identify with
Durnford Point&mdash;the Ponta da Pescaria of the old charts&mdash;300
miles beyond the Rio de Infante (which was Dias’s
furthest), and 370 miles beyond the Ilhéo da Cruz. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
daily run since December 20th had thus averaged 46
miles.</p>

<p>Vasco da Gama then stood off the land, for reasons not
given by any of the historians. Whether it was from fear
of being driven upon a lee-shore by a strong easterly wind,
or the hope of being able to shorten his passage by a
more direct north-easterly course, we are unable to tell.
However that may be, a fortnight passed before the vessels
returned to the land, so that drinking-water began to fail,
and the men had to be put on short rations. It was on
the 11th of January that Vasco da Gama found himself off
the mouth of a small river, the Rio do Cobre, where he
established friendly relations with the “good people” of a
country ruled by petty chiefs.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> The distance of this river
from the “Fishing Point” is only 315 miles, and contrary
winds must therefore have driven the little flotilla far out
of its direct course, but not as far as the neighbourhood of
Madagascar, for southerly winds would have been picked
up there, which would have carried it more speedily
towards its destination than was possible in the face of the
south-easterly winds prevailing along the coast of Africa.</p>

<p>After a stay of five days, Vasco da Gama left the Rio do
Cobre on January 16th, and without further incident, and
leaving Sofala far to the west, he arrived off the mouth
of the Rio dos Bons Signaes (Kilimani) on January 24th,
having thus accomplished a distance of 480 miles in eight
days. Coelho’s caravel at once crossed the bar to take
soundings, and the two ships followed on the next day.
In this river Vasco da Gama stayed 31 days, careening his
vessels, refreshing his crews, and erecting a padrão dedicated
to S. Raphael (see p. <a href="#Page_19">19</a>). It was here that he heard
the glad tidings of more civilised regions in front of him.</p>

<p>On February 24th the vessels once more gained the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>open sea, and following the coast for six days arrived
off Mozambique on March 2nd. During this voyage of
330 miles they kept outside the islands which here skirt
the coast, and lay to at night, as usual, which accounts for
the slow rate of progress made during this coasting voyage.
Coelho, as before, led the way, and entered by the shallow
southern channel, between the islands of S. Thiago and
S. Jorge. The three vessels anchored in front of the town
(see p. <a href="#Page_23">23</a>). Later on they removed to the island of
S. Jorge, where mass was read on March 12th, after
which the little flotilla set sail for the north. Two days
afterwards, the Soriza Peaks rose in the distance. In the
course of that day they were becalmed. A light easterly
wind arose, and at night on the 14th they stood off shore;
and when in the morning of the 15th they looked about
them, they found that the Mozambique current, which here
frequently runs at the rate of two to four knots to the
southward, had swept them twelve miles abaft Mozambique.
Sailing vessels are advised,<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> under such circumstances, to
stand to the eastward for sixty miles or more, and regain
their northing beyond the influence of the southerly
current. Of course, Vasco da Gama knew nothing about
all this. Fortunately, he was able to recover his old
anchorage at the island of S. Jorge in the course of the
afternoon.</p>

<p>A fresh start was made on March 29th. This time the
wind was favourable. The Moorish pilot whom Vasco da
Gama had on board took him past Kilwa, which the
captain would have liked to have visited, and shaped a
course outside Mafia, Zanzibar and the other islands lying
off that coast. Early on April 7th the <i>S. Raphael</i> ran
aground near Mtangata, but was speedily got off; and on
April 7th Vasco da Gama cast anchor in the outer road of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>Mombasa, the finest port on the whole coast of Eastern
Africa. The distance thus accomplished in the course of
nine days was 690 miles (see p. <a href="#Page_34">34</a>).</p>

<p>Sixty miles more brought the Portuguese to the roadstead
of Melinde, where they cast anchor on April 14th,
and remained until the 24th. This was the only town at
which they met with a cordial reception (p. 40).</p>

<p class="center padt1"><i>Across the Arabian Gulf to Calecut.</i></p>

<p>On April 24th Vasco da Gama, who had secured the services
of a Gujarati pilot, started for India. By that time the
S.W. monsoon was blowing steadily, though not as yet
very strongly. The African coast was kept in sight for a
couple of days, after which the vessels stood boldly across
the “Great Gulf.” They passed in all probability to the
south of the <i>Baixos de Padua</i>. They had been twenty-one
days at sea, and were still 24 miles from the land, when
there rose in front of them a lofty wooded mountain.
This was Mount Eli, 2,220 miles from Melinde, and the day
on which India was first beheld by Europeans who had
come direct from a European port was May 18th, a Friday
(see p. <a href="#Page_47">47</a>).<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a></p>

<p>Galvão<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> is the only author who mentions the “Flats of
Padua,”<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a> as having been discovered by Vasco da Gama on
his outward voyage, and we freely accept his statement,
for the Portuguese must either have crossed the Laccadives
or passed to the north of them. As these islands are very
low, the author of the <i>Roteiro</i> may not have thought it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>worth while to mention them. It is evident, however, from
what Sernigi says (p. 134), as also from the evidence of the
earliest maps illustrating this voyage, that the Portuguese
learnt a good deal about them from the pilots whom they
employed.</p>

<p>On the following day, having stood off during the night,
the captain-major again approached the land, but the
western Ghats were wrapped in clouds, and it rained
heavily, so that the pilot failed to identify the locality.
The day after, however, the 20th of May, having passed
Monte Formosa (see p. <a href="#Page_47">47</a>, note 6), he recognised the lofty
mountains above Calecut, and in the evening of that day
the little fleet was riding at anchor about five miles off
Capocate, or Capua, a small town only seven miles to the
north of the much-desired city, which was pointed out to
the expectant Portuguese (p. 48). Soon afterwards Vasco
da Gama took up a position right in front of that city;<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a>
but on May 27th a pilot of the Zamorin guided him to an
anchorage off Pandarani, thirteen miles to the north, on
the ground of its greater safety, and at that anchorage
the Portuguese remained no less than 88 days, until
August 23rd, when Vasco da Gama once more took up a
position four leagues to the leeward of Calecut. From
that time to the day of his final departure, in the afternoon
of August 30th, he hovered about that city, standing off
and on, as the state of the weather or the exigencies of
his relations with the Zamorin required.</p>

<p class="center padt1"><i>The Voyage Home.</i></p>

<p>In the afternoon of August 30th, a tornado carried
Vasco da Gama out to sea (p. 77), and when making his
way along the coast he was obliged to tack, depending for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>his progress upon land and sea breezes, and laying-to when
becalmed. At Cananor he sent ashore one of his captives
(p. 79), but held no communication with the town himself.
On September 15th he landed on a small island, and
erected the padrão dedicated to St. Mary (p. 80).<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a></p>

<p>On September 20th Vasco da Gama arrived at the
Anjediva Islands, about 14° 45´ N., having thus spent
twenty-one days in accomplishing 240 miles. He seems,
first of all, to have anchored near the Oyster Rocks, off the
Kalipadi river, but on September 24th he landed on the
largest of these islands, where he remained until October
5th, waiting for a propitious wind, and availed himself
of the enforced leisure to careen the flagship and the
<i>Berrio</i> (p. 83).</p>

<p>The passage across the gulf proved a fearful trial for the
Portuguese. Foul winds and calms impeded their progress,
whilst a renewed outbreak of scurvy carried off thirty
victims and prostrated the remaining men, so that only
seven or eight were fit to do duty in each vessel. Vasco
da Gama had left Anjediva on October 5th (a Friday!),
although the N.E. monsoon only sets in at the end of the
month, and ninety days elapsed before the African coast
came within sight, near Magadoxo, and five more before
the hard-proved mariners once more found themselves with
the friendly Sultan of Melinde (p. 89).</p>

<p>The remainder of the voyage home calls for little comment.
Having left Melinde on January 11th, Vasco da
Gama, passing between the mainland and Zanzibar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>stopped for a fortnight at the “baixos” upon which the
<i>S. Raphael</i> had run in the outward voyage, and there
that doomed ship was set on fire, as there were no men
left to sail her. Late on February 1st the remaining two
vessels hove to in front of S. Jorge Island, where a padrão
was erected on the following morning in drenching rain.
The voyage was continued without communicating with
the town of Moçambique, and on March 3rd Vasco once
more found himself in the Bay of S. Braz.</p>

<p>The Cape was doubled on March 20th. The wind
proved fair during twenty-seven days&mdash;that is, to April
16th or 17th&mdash;but after came calms and foul winds; and
on April 25th, when the wearied mariners already believed
themselves to be near S. Thiago, the pilots told them that
they had only reached the shoals off the Rio Grande (p. 93).</p>

<p>Here the two consorts appear to have parted company,
under circumstances not known; and whilst Vasco
da Gama accompanied his dying brother to Terçeira,
Coelho is said to have made straight for Lisbon, where he
arrived, after a voyage of seventy-six days, on July 10th.
The distance along the coast of Africa is only 1,900 miles,
and that by way of the Azores, the only route at all
suitable for sailing vessels, is 2,920 miles. The passage
ought certainly to have been accomplished in forty days.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a>
What did he do during the remaining thirty-six days?
We cannot suppose for one moment that an experienced
sailor like Coelho would have faced the head-winds of the
coast for the sake of shortening the distance to be run.
Still, such things <i>have</i> happened.</p>

<p>From the following statement of distances run it will
be seen that from July 8th, 1497, the day of Vasco da
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>Gama’s departure from Lisbon to the return of Coelho on
July 10th, 1499, there elapsed 732 days, or two years and
two days. Of this time 316 days were expended before
Calecut was reached, 102 at Calecut and in its vicinity,
and 314 on the homeward passage.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a></p>

<h2>APPENDIX G.</h2>

<h3>EARLY MAPS ILLUSTRATING VASCO DA GAMA’S
FIRST VOYAGE.</h3>

<p>It must ever be matter for regret that none of the sailing
charts prepared by Vasco da Gama’s pilots should have
reached us. In tracing the progress of his expedition with
the aid of charts we are consequently dependent upon
compilations which, although contemporary, embody also
materials brought home by other navigators.</p>

<p>One great drawback of all the charts available for our
purpose is their small scale.<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> This compelled their compilers
to make a selection from the names which they found
inserted upon the larger charts at their disposal, and this
selection may not always have been a judicious one. The
compilation of a map from discordant materials presents
difficulties even in the present day, and these difficulties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>were much greater at a time when the compiler had not at
his command trustworthy observations for latitude which
would have enabled him to check the positions of intermediate
places, and bring into agreement the records
brought home by successive explorers. As an instance, we
may mention that in the five maps which we shall bring
more fully under notice, the latitude assigned to the Cape
of Good Hope varies between 29° and 34° S., its true
position being 34° 22´ S. As to longitudes, they had to be
determined by dead reckoning, and it need not therefore
surprise us if, on the maps referred to, the Cape is placed
from 3° 50´ to 10° 20´ too far to the eastward. Nay, this
near approach to the truth, in at least one instance, compels
our recognition of the skill of the men who piloted the
first ships around that long-sought <i>Cabo desejado</i>.</p>

<p>Another difficulty arises from the crabbed characters
employed by the map draughtsmen of the early part of
the sixteenth century: a difficulty all the more serious
when these illegible characters had to be reproduced by
Italians having no knowledge of the language of the
documents they used, or the meaning of the uncouth names
which they were called upon to copy. It is one of the great
merits of Mercator to have caused these characters to be
banished from the maps of his countrymen; but a second
Mercator is still wanted to do the same good work for
their printed books.</p>

<p>I now proceed to a consideration of the charts which
illustrate more especially Vasco da Gama’s first voyage.</p>

<p>The first of these charts is by Henricus Martellus
Germanus. It is one of many in a MS., <i>Insularium illustratum</i>,
now in the British Museum (Add. MS. 15760). It
is a map of the world, very roughly drawn and without a
scale, and is dated 1489, that is almost immediately after
the return of Dias in the December of the preceding year.
The author, no doubt, was an Italian, and other maps by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
his skilful hand are known to exist.<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> Unfortunately for
our purpose, the coast beyond the Cape is very incorrectly
drawn, and there are but six names, viz., Golfo
dentro delle serre (False Bay), Rio della vacche (Gouritz),
Cavo dalhado (talhado, Seal Point), Golfo de Pastori (St.
Francis Bay), Padrom de S. George (instead of Gregorio),
and Ilha de fonte (instead of infante).<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a></p>

<p>The first map illustrating, or rather attempting to
illustrate, Vasco da Gama’s voyage is that compiled by
Juan de la Cosa, the famous pilot of Columbus, in 1500.
The author was fairly well informed of the discoveries
made by his own countrymen, but knew apparently but
little about those of the Portuguese. Thus, although
Vicente Yanez Pinzon only returned to Spain on September
30th, 1500, the coast explored by him to the westward of
the Rostro hermoso (the Cabo de Agostinho of the Portuguese)
is laid down properly; whilst Santa Cruz, discovered
by Cabral in April 1500, is incorrectly indicated,<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> although
Gaspar de Lemos, whom Cabral sent back with the news
of his discovery, arrived in Portugal three months before
the Spanish navigator. As to two groups of islands in
the southern Atlantic, namely, “thebas, yslas tibras etiopicas
yn mare oceanum austral” (lat 1° 40´ S.), and “Y.
tausens, ylas tausens montises etiopicus oceanas” (lat.
15° S.), they seem to be quite imaginary, and I only refer
to them here because they kept their place on later maps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>and might be mistaken for the islands discovered by João
da Nova in 1501-2. Of the results of Vasco da Gama’s
expedition Juan de la Cosa must have been very ill-informed;
among the many uncouth and incomprehensible
names inserted by him along the Eastern coast of Africa
there is not one which can be traced to Gama. Not even
such places as Sofala, Quiloa, Moçambique and Mombaça
can be identified, whilst Zanzibar and Madagascar lie far
out in the Indian Ocean.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a></p>

<p>The coastline of the Indian Ocean is Ptolemaic; there
is no hint at the peninsular shape of India, the map being
in that respect inferior to that of the Catalan, more than a
hundred years older, and the only indication of Vasco da
Gama’s visit to these seas is the name “Calicut”, placed
on the south coast of Caramania (Kerman), with a legend
to the east of it: “tierra descubierto por el rey dom Manuel
rey de Portugal.”<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a></p>

<p>Our next chart shows a great advance upon the preceding.
It was purchased at a sale in London, and is now
the property of Dr. Hamy, who published a description of
it, with facsimiles, in his <i>Études historiques et géographiques</i>,
Paris, 1896. The author is not known. His chart places
on record the discoveries made by Vicente Yanez Pinzon,
Cabral, Sancho de Toar, and Cortereal, and by the expedition
which King Manuel sent to Brazil in 1501, and which
returned at the beginning of September, 1502.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> This
expedition, which was accompanied by Vespucci, explored
the American coast as far as the Rio de Cananea, in lat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>25° 45´ S. The author knows nothing of the discoveries of
João da Nova, who returned to Lisbon on September 11th,
1502. We may therefore safely date his map “1502”, as is
done by Dr. Hamy.</p>

<p>One curious feature of this map is its double equator:
that for the western half of the map being the ‘new’
equator, to which the recent discoveries of the Spaniards
and Portuguese are to be referred, whilst that for the east
lies four degrees to the north of the former, and is taken
from Ptolemy. Indeed, the outline of the Indian Ocean is
Ptolemy’s, and so is the nomenclature, with a few exceptions
to be noticed presently. In the south-east, however,
the author has broken through Ptolemy’s encircling barrier,
and has thus opened a way from the <i>Indicum mare</i> to an
outer ocean where room has been found for Seilam, Iava and
far Quinsai. The eastern edge of his Oekumene lies 205°
to the east of Lisbon (196° E. of Greenwich).<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> The only
original features within the Indian Ocean are a peninsular
India, which is made to project from Ptolemy’s old coastline
to the west of Taprobana, with a town, “Colochuti”,
and the islands of Madagascar and Tangibar lying far out
at sea in lat. 20° S. The only other modern name within
this wide area is “Malacha”, which is placed in the Aurea
Chersonesus.</p>

<p>The nomenclature along the African coast is fairly full,
and evidently taken from original sources,<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> but the spelling
is so corrupt, and the letters are frequently so illegible, that
I failed to make out many of the names, although I had
that portion of the map which specially interested me
enlarged from Dr. Hamy’s facsimile by photography. An
examination of the copy, which I give, will show that the
drawing of the coast-line leaves very much to be desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>A very great advance upon the preceding is shown by a
chart which Alberto Cantino, the correspondent of Hercules
d’Este, Duke of Ferrara, caused to be specially designed
for his patron, at Lisbon, and for which he paid twelve
golden ducats. There can be no doubt about the date
of this map. It was begun after Cortereal’s return,
October 11th, 1501, and had been completed some time
before November, 1502. The MS. of this valuable chart
is deposited in the Biblioteca Estense at Modena. The
American portion of it has been published by Mr. Harrisse
(<i>Les Cortereals</i>, Paris, 1888<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a>), and the Indian Section by the
Vienna Geographical Society.<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> Through the kindness of
Signor M. C. Caputo, librarian of the Biblioteca Estense,
who procured for me an excellent photograph, I am
enabled to publish Africa from the Gulf of Guinea to
Makhdesho. An examination of this reproduction will at
once establish the superiority of this chart over those
already noticed, as also over later charts. The outline of
Africa is wonderfully correct, considering the age of the
chart, and the broad face presented by that continent to
the south is brought out most satisfactorily. Unfortunately,
several of the names along the south coast are rendered
illegible, even on the original, owing to the coloured Table
Mountain, and I have failed to decipher these satisfactorily,
notwithstanding the kind help afforded me by
Signor Caputo. Along the east coast there is a paucity
of names. It should be observed that the padrões and
Portuguese flags have been located somewhat at haphazard.</p>

<p>Whilst the African coast is taken exclusively from
recent Portuguese sources, that of India and Further India
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>is largely based upon native information. This is proved
by some of the legends. At Çatiguam we read “esta em
xi pulgados a o norte,” but these “pulgados” or inches
are clearly the “isbas” of the “Mohit,” a mode of expressing
the latitude which is peculiar to the Indian Ocean and has
been explained by me on p. <a href="#Page_26">26</a>, note 4.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i209.jpg" width="500" height="336" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Sidi Ali Ben Hosein’s
MOHIT
1554.</p></div>

<p>In order to enable the reader to judge of the extent to
which the compilers of early Portuguese maps were indebted
to native sailing directories and charts, and of the
judgment exercised by them in their use, I insert here a
reduction of Dr. Tomaschek’s elaborate reconstruction of
a chart in accordance with the data contained in Admiral
Sidi Ali ben Hosein’s “Mohit,” or “Encyclopædia of the
Sea,” which, although only written in 1554, embodies the
local knowledge gained in the course of centuries, and is
not indebted to Portuguese charts for its superiority.<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>
<p>The next chart to be considered is by Nicolas de
Canerio, of Genoa. Its date is undoubtedly the same as
that of the Cantino Map, that is, it was drawn before the
results of João da Nova’s voyage had become available.
This is proved by finding “y. tebas, iste insulle chamada
secular” in the mid-Atlantic (9° S.), with a Portuguese flag,
for these islands are borrowed from Juan de la Cosa, and
have nothing to do with Conceiçao (Ascension) or St.
Helena, discovered by João da Nova. It is almost wholly
based upon the materials previously utilised by Cantino’s
draughtsman, although more detailed in outline and with
a more ample nomenclature in some places. The shape of
Africa, however, is far more correctly given on Cantino’s
chart than on Canerio’s,<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> and the technical workmanship
of the former is of a superior character. The legends on
both maps have evidently been taken from the same source:
those on Cantino’s map, as far as I have been able to
examine it, appearing to be more numerous and in some
cases fuller.</p>

<p>The MS. of this important chart is at present in the
Hydrographic Office at Paris. Prof. L. Gallois, whose
contributions to the history of geography are highly
appreciated by all interested in the subject, has given
an account of it in the <i>Bulletin</i> of the Geographical
Society of Lyons.<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> This account is accompanied by a
reproduction of two sections of the map, viz., America and
Africa. Prof. Gallois has had the extreme kindness to
supply me with a tracing of the Asiatic portion of the
map, and has thus enabled me to produce Map VII, illus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>trating
this volume. My reproduction contains all the
names of the original to the east of the Cape of Good
Hope, whilst the legends for which there was no room
upon the Reduction are given at the end of this Appendix.</p>

<p>On examining this chart it will at once be seen that the
author&mdash;not the Italian copyist, whose name alone appears
upon it&mdash;drew very largely upon native information. Still,
he has not ventured to disassociate himself altogether
from Ptolemy. He has, however, made some use of
Marco Polo, though he puts the names taken from
him&mdash;such as Murfulu, Var and Coilu&mdash;in the wrong
places. The island in the middle of the Indian ocean&mdash;Y.
rana&mdash;is not one of the Mascarenhas, as might be supposed,
but the Illa Iaua of the Catalan map, that is, Java.
The legend tells us that “In this island is much benjoim,
and silk and porcelain.” Still further south there are three
islands, representing the Mascarenhas, then known by
Malabari names.</p>

<p>A few words remain to be said about the Portuguese maps
published in the Strassburg edition of Ptolemy, in 1513.
The originals upon which these maps are based were sent
to Duke Renée II of Lorraine (died 1508), from Portugal.
Uebelin and Essler, the editors of Ptolemy, state that
they were drawn by an “admiral” of King Ferdinand. But
Lelewel<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> points out that the king meant must be D. Manuel
of Portugal. They may have been forwarded together with
the French translation of Vespucci’s <i>Four Voyages</i>, 1504,
and Vespucci may even have had something to do with
their compilation, even though not the actual compiler.
But however this may be, and whatever the date of actual
publication, there can be no doubt that they are identical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>in all essentials with Canerio’s chart, and must be referred
to the same date, that is 1502.<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a></p>

<p>On placing side by side some of the above charts it
almost looks as if they were not merely based upon the
same original authorities, but had actually been slavishly
copied one from the other, or from some common prototype.
On a closer examination, however, this opinion is not
sustainable, for the latitudes and longitudes assigned by
the authors to the leading points will be found to differ
very considerably. The following little table show this
as regards the latitudes:&mdash;</p>

Bahia de lagoa (Lagoon Bay), perhaps after the Rio da lagoa (Lagoon River),
which figures very prominently on Dr. Hamy’s and Cantino’s Charts, and
almost seems to represent the Rio de Infante in the case of the former.

<p>
The Kasuga River, which is closed at its mouth, and forms a lake-like
expansion at the back of the dunes, seems to correspond more nearly with the
conditions required. Several other rivers, to the east and west of it, present
the same feature, and these may have given rise to the designation “Praia
das alagôas”, <i>i.e.</i>, Shore of Lagoons.

<h3>HONOURS AND REWARDS BESTOWED UPON VASCO
DA GAMA, 1499-1524.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">King Manuel</span> has not infrequently been charged with
a niggardly disposition, but whatever his conduct may
have been in other instances there can be no doubt that
he dealt most liberally with the navigator who was the
first to sail a ship from a European port to India. This
liberality had been called forth by the sensation produced
by the discovery of an ocean highway to India, and the
expectation that great wealth would pour into Portugal as
a consequence; it was kept alive by the persistent importunities
of the discoverer.</p>

<p>Vasco da Gama certainly did not undervalue the services
he had rendered to the King. He considered himself entitled
to a high reward, and in the end secured it. His
ambition, from the very first, seems to have been to take
his place among the territorial nobles of his native land.
His father, Estevão da Gama, had at one time been
Alcaide-mór of Sines, he himself had been born at that picturesque
old fishing town, and his desire to be territorially
connected with it was therefore only natural. The King was
quite willing that this should be, but Sines belonged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>to the Order of S. Thiago, of which D. Jorge, Duke of
Coimbra, a natural son of D. João II, was master; and
although a papal dispensation had been received in 1501,
which empowered the Order to exchange Sines for some
other town, the Order refused to part with it (see Document
1). Meanwhile the King, on February 22, 1501, had
granted Vasco da Gama not only an annual pension of
1,000 cruzados (<i>£</i>483), but also the territorial title of
“Dom” (Documents 2 and 3).<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a></p>

<p>Still further favours were conferred upon Vasco da
Gama on January 10, 1502, only one month previous to
his second departure for India; and this, we are told, was
done “freely”, and without these favours having been solicited
either by their recipient or by any of his friends (see Document
4). These favours included an annual hereditary
pension of 300,000 reis (<i>£</i>362), the title of “Admiral of
India”, with all the valuable privileges conferred by it;<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a>
the right of sending annually to India 200 cruzados, to be
laid out in merchandise, upon which no import duties were
to be levied, excepting the 5 per cent. claimed by the Order
of Christ,<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> and confirmation of the hereditary title of
“Dom”, which was also to be borne by his brother Ayres,
and in its feminine form of “Dona” by his sister Theresa.</p>

<p>A few months after Vasco da Gama’s return from his
second voyage, the King, who was especially pleased
with the “tribute” received from the Sultan of Kilwa,
bestowed upon him a further hereditary pension of 400,000
reis (1,000 cruzados, or <i>£</i>483). This was done on February
4, 1504 (Document 5).</p>

<p>Meanwhile the negotiations for putting Gama in possession
of Sines had made no progress, and the Admiral,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>impatient of the delay, took up his residence in that town,
began to build himself a manor-house, and generally conducted
himself as if the town were his own. The alcaidemór,
D. Luiz de Noronha, did not venture to interfere,
but the Order of S. Thiago complained to the King; and
the King, justly incensed at the masterful conduct of his
vassal, peremptorily ordered his Admiral to quit Sines
within thirty days, and not to return to it except by
special permission of the Master of S. Thiago. This order
was dated March 21, 1507 (see Document 7). We need
scarcely say that it was obeyed.</p>

<p>But the Admiral still hankered after the territorial honours
which had been promised him. He enjoyed already
three royal pensions amounting to 2,750 cruzados (<i>£</i>1,328),
and Leonardo Masser,<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> the Venetian Ambassador at Lisbon,
estimated the whole of his income at that time at 4,000
ducats, or rather cruzados (<i>£</i>1,930). This was a very large
sum indeed. There were at that time only six noblemen,
two archbishops, and seven bishops in all Portugal whose
income exceeded his.<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a></p>

<p>In November, 1508, the King authorised Luiz d’Arca to
cede to Vasco da Gama the alcaideria-mór of Villafranca
de Xira (see Document 8), but the negotiations appear to
have led to no result. Ten years were allowed to pass,
when the Admiral informed the King that, the promised
title of “Count” not having been conferred upon him, he
desired permission to emigrate with his family. The King,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>on August 17, 1518 (see Document 13), granted this permission,
on condition that the Admiral should defer his
departure until the end of the year. In the meantime he
seriously looked about him for the territorial qualification
which would enable him to confer upon his importunate
Admiral the title of Count. D. Jayme, Duke of Bragança,
a nephew of the King, who held Vasco da Gama in high
respect, was willing to accommodate his uncle. By an
agreement signed on November 4, 1519, he surrendered
the towns of Vidigueira and Villa de Frades, in consideration
of Vasco da Gama ceding to him an hereditary Royal
pension of 400,000 reis (1,000 cruzados), and in addition,
paying the sum of 4,000 cruzados in gold. This transaction
having been completed at Evora, on November 7,
the King, in Document 16, granted to Vasco da Gama,
his heirs and successors, the towns of Vidigueira and Villa
de Frades, together with all revenues and privileges
hitherto enjoyed by the Duke of Bragança; and on
December 29 he conferred upon his Admiral the title of
“Conde de Vidigueira” (see Documents 14-17).</p>

<p>And thus, when Vasco da Gama, in April, 1524, departed
for the last time for India, the great ambition of his life
had been realised. He died at Cochin, on Christmas eve
of the same year.</p>

<p>By Letters Patent, dated Lisbon, December 24, 1499, the King,
in recognition of the merits of Vasco da Gama, and the great
services rendered by him in the discovery of India, grants to
him, his heirs and successors, the town of Sines, together with all
the revenues, privileges, and tithes pertaining thereto, as well as
civil and criminal jurisdiction. But inasmuch as this town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>belongs to the Order of São Thiago, the formal title-deeds are
to be drawn up only after this Order shall have received satisfaction
by the grant of another town belonging to the Crown, and dispensation
of the Holy Father, sanctioning this exchange, shall
have been received.</p>

<p>Satisfaction was, moreover, to be given to D. Luiz de Noronha,
the alcaide-mór of the said city. But should D. Luiz refuse to
surrender the said alcaideria, then, the dispensation of the Pope
having been received, the King promises at once to put Vasco da

as soon as terms shall have been arranged with D. Luiz de

<p>D. Manuel after pointing out, in these letters-patent, that the
explorations begun by the Infante D. Henry [the Navigator] in
1433,<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> in the hope of discovering a new highway to India, had
been continued by King Alfonso and King John, at an expenditure
of many lives and of much treasure, until, in 1482,<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> the Rio
do Infante, at a distance of 1,885 leagues, had been reached,
continues:</p>

<p>“Being animated by an ardent desire to continue the work
initiated by the Infante and our predecessors, and being assured
that Vasco da Gama, a gentleman of our household, was well
qualified for rendering us this service, and would disregard the
perils to his person and the risk of life which he ran in accomplishing
the task set him, we sent him to India as captain-major
of our fleet, and with him Paulo da Gama, his brother, and
Nicolau Coelho, likewise a gentleman of our household. In
this voyage he did most excellent service, for whilst only 1885
leagues of coast had been discovered during the many years
which had elapsed since the commencement of this enterprise,
and by the many captains sent out, he by himself, in this
single voyage, discovered 1550 leagues, in addition to a great
gold-mine and many wealthy towns and cities, having a great
trade, and finally reached and discovered that India, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
all those who have given descriptions of the world rank higher
in wealth than any other country, which from all time had been
coveted by the Emperors and Kings of the world, and for the sake
of which such heavy expenses had been incurred in this kingdom,
and so many captains and others forfeited their lives&mdash;a country,
in fact, which all kings not only desired to possess but even to
discover.</p>

<p>“This discovery, begun years ago, he accomplished at a
greater sacrifice of life and of treasure, and at greater peril to
his own person, than suffered by those who preceded him. Paulo
da Gama, his brother, died in the course of the voyage, as also
one-half of the people whom we sent out with this <i>armada</i>, they
having passed through many perils, not only because of the
length of this voyage, which exceeded two years, but also because
of the desire to furnish trustworthy information on these territories
and all connected with them.</p>

<p>“And bearing in mind the great services yielded to ourselves
and our kingdoms by this voyage and discovery; the great
advantages accruing thence, not only to our kingdoms but to all
Christendom; the injury done to the infidels [<i>i.e.</i>, Mohammedans]
who, up till now, have enjoyed the advantages offered by India;
and more especially the hope that all the people of India will
rally round Our Lord, seeing that they may easily be led to
a knowledge of His holy faith, some of them already being
instructed in it; desiring, moreover, to recompense him for his
services, as befits a prince when dealing with those who have so
greatly and so well served him, and to bestow upon him a grace
and favour; with full knowledge, and out of our royal and
absolute power, without his having solicited it, nor any other
person on his behalf, we grant him, freely and irrevocably, from
this day in perpetuity, an annuity of 300,000 reis, to be paid to
him and his descendants.”</p>

<p>For the payment of this annuity the King assigns the new tithe
on fish imposed upon the towns of Sines and Villanova de
Milfontes, supposed to yield 60,000 reis annually, which tithe
has been surrendered by Martinho de Castelbranco, who held it
from the Crown, and has been compensated elsewhere. Any
surplus receipts out of this tithe were to be retained by Vasco da
Gama, the King, on the other hand, not being obliged to make
up any deficiencies. Secondly, the King surrenders 130,000 reis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
annually out of the excise levied upon Sines, any deficiency in
that amount to be made up out of the excise of S. Thiago de
Cacem. Thirdly, the King assigns to him 40,000 reis, to be paid
out of the excise of S. Thiago. Lastly, the 70,000 reis still wanted
to make up the 300,000 reis shall be paid out of the receipts of
the timber octroi of the city of Lisbon.</p>

<p>In addition the King appoints him Admiral of India, conferring
all honours, franchises and revenues which that rank carries with
it, throughout the territories which shall be placed under the rule
of the King.</p>

<p>Moreover, he is granted the privilege of sending annually, by the
royal vessels, 200 cruzados to India, to be laid out in merchandise,
upon the importation of which no duties whatever shall be levied
except the 5 per cent. payable to the Order of Christ; this privilege
to be transmitted to his descendants.</p>

<p>The King, moreover, confers upon him, his brother Ayres da
Gama, and his sister, Tarayja (Theresa) da Gama, the hereditary
title of Dom (Dona).</p>

<p>Finally, the King desires that the heirs of Vasco da Gama
shall always bear the name of Gama, in memory of the said
Vasco da Gama.</p>

<p>The King, having pointed out that as Divine justice recompenses,
in the other world, those who have firmly adhered to the
Catholic faith and practised good works, so should the Kings and
Princes of this world recompense those who have rendered them
faithful service, directs attention to the signal services rendered
by Vasco da Gama during his first voyage, when he discovered
India. This discovery has resulted in a great accession of
wealth. What the Romans, and Emperors and Kings have vainly
attempted, has been accomplished by the said Admiral, and the
advantages coveted by all nations have been secured to his kingdoms.
These results have been attained at a great loss of life, for
more than half the men in this first expedition have succumbed,
and among them Paulo da Gama, the brother of the Admiral.
On his return honours and other rewards were conferred on
the Admiral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of a second voyage<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> the services rendered by
him have been equally brilliant. The King of Kilwa has been
reduced to submission, and compelled to pay an annual tribute of
1,500 mitkals in gold,<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> the first instalment of which has been
received. This king is very powerful, and the owner of the
gold mines of Sofala, the richest in that part of the world.
In all other respects Vasco da Gama has faithfully guarded the
royal interests, both in making war upon the Moors of Mecca,
and in peaceable negotiations with the kings of those countries.
The fleet intrusted to him, owing to the wisdom and judgment
exercised, has returned richly laden. On these grounds he is
entitled to some recompense. Acting as becomes a King, and
considering his merits, he, D. Manuel, therefore grants him, and
his male descendants in the direct line, an annuity of 400,000
reis, to commence on the first of January of this year, 1504,
and to be secured on the salt tax of the city of Lisbon.</p>

<p>The King instructs Fernão Lourenço, factor of the Guinea and
India trade, to pay henceforth the annuity of 1,000 cruzados
to Vasco da Gama; each caravel coming from the city of S. Jorge
da Mina is to contribute 32,500 reis, the payments out of twelve
caravels thus making up a total of 390,000 reis.</p>

the Admiral of India, is informed that within thirty days after
date he must withdraw from the town of Sines, with his wife
and the whole of his household, and that neither himself, nor his
wife, nor his household can be permitted to return to that town,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>or its precincts, except by permission of the Master [of the Order
of São Thiago and Aviz]. In case any of them should enter
the town without such permission, they will render themselves
liable to a fine of fifty cruzados, beyond which they will incur
the punishment deserved by those who refuse obedience to the
orders of their King and Lord. In a postscript the King orders,
moreover, that the same penalty shall be incurred if Vasco da
Gama continue the buildings he has commenced.</p>

<p>(This Royal Edict was presented on June 26, 1507, at the

<p>The King orders the authorities (“judges”) of the Order of

<p>The King informs all whom it may concern that in consideration
of the merits and very great services of Dom Vasco da
Gama, it pleases him to order that no freights be charged upon
merchandise forwarded to the Admiral from India, whether sent
by royal or private ships, the expenses, in the latter case, being
charged to the India House. This privilege is not to extend to
certain spices reserved for the Crown.</p>

<p>1). Manuel, having quoted <i>in extenso</i> the conditions of a pension
of 400,000 reis granted on February 4, 1504, orders that one-half
this pension shall be paid in future out of the revenues of the
town of Niza,<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> and the other out of the salt-tax, as before.</p>

<p>The Admiral having reminded the King that the title of
“Count” has been promised him, but has not yet been conferred,
asks permission to leave the kingdom. The King, in a
letter in which he addresses Vasco da Gama as “Almirante
amiguo”, replies: “We order you to remain in our kingdom
up to the end of December of the present year, and we hope
by that time you will have seen the error you are about to
commit, and desire to serve us as is seeming, and not take the
extreme course proposed. But if by that time you are still
minded to go, we shall not hinder your departure, with your wife,
your sons, and all your moveable property. Done at Lisbon
by the Secretary [Antonio Carneiro], August 17, 1518.... The

<p>The King authorises Vasco da Gama to surrender his pension
of 400,000 reis [see No. 5], to D. Jayme, Duke of Bragança, and
the latter to give in exchange the towns of Vidigueira and Villa de
Frades.</p>

<p>D. Jayme, Duke of Bragança and Guimaraes, authorises his
“ouvidor” (bailiff), João Alves, to surrender the towns of Vidigueira
and Villa de Frades, with all their revenues, etc., to D. Vasco
da Gama, on condition of the latter ceding to him an hereditary
pension of 400,000 reis, which he has from the King, and of
paying, in addition, a sum of 4,000 cruzados in gold.</p>

<p>[This transaction was completed at Evora, where Vasco da
Gama resided, on November 7, the 4,000 cruzados being paid in
Portugueses of 10 cruzados each. As the eldest sons of the
contracting parties, D. Theodesio of Bragança and D. Francisco
da Gama, were still minors, it was agreed that the King should be
asked to “overlook this deficiency of age”, so that they, too,
should be bound by this agreement.<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a>]</p>

<p>The King, having sanctioned the arrangement between the
Duke of Bragança and Vasco da Gama, and having dwelt once
more upon the good services rendered by the latter not only to the
Crown, but also to the inhabitants of the kingdom, and to all
Christendom, grants to him and his heirs, irrevocably and for all
time, the towns of Vidigueira and Villa de Frades, together with
all privileges, including civil and criminal jurisdiction and church
patronage, which had been enjoyed by the Dukes of Bragança,
[These privileges, it should be understood, exceeded those
usually enjoyed by a mere Count.]</p>

<p>D. Manoel, after a glowing eulogy of the services rendered by
his Admiral of India, confers upon him the title of Count of
Vidigueira, together with all prerogatives, rights, graces, privileges,
liberties and franchises enjoyed by the Counts of the Kingdom
by usage and ancient custom.</p>

<p>D. João III confirms Vasco da Gama’s claim, as Admiral, to
the anchorage dues paid at Malacca, Goa and Ormuz, and
authorises him to appoint receivers.</p>

<p>The Admiral, being about to proceed to India for a third time,
the King, D. João III, is pleased to order that in case of his death
his son and heir shall forthwith assume the title of Count of
Vidigueira, and enter upon the enjoyment of all privileges, etc., to
which this rank entitles him.</p></blockquote>

When returning from Cananor he shaped a direct course across
the Indian Ocean to Mozambique. After a long period of rest,
King João III again sent him to India in 1524, but he died at
Cochin on December 25th of the same year, at the age of sixty-five.
His remains were taken to Portugal in 1538, and deposited
at Vidigueira. Since 1880 they are supposed to have found
their last resting-place in the church of Belem.

when he writes from Jamaica that the “Emperor of Catayo asked
long ago (<i>ha dias</i>) for men of learning to instruct him in the

45 miles. If the dates in the text were correct, he would have made
12½ leagues daily up to August 18th, and between that date and the
22nd (allowing for the delay) at least 300 leagues (1,010 miles), which
is quite impossible. It is evident that the second date is wrong, and
instead of “the same month”, we ought perhaps to read “October”.
In that case the daily progress, up to October 22nd, would have
averaged 10 leagues (34 miles). Thence, to St. Helena Bay, a distance
of 370 leagues accomplished in 16 days, the daily progress would
have averaged nearly 23 leagues (78 miles). Of course these are
merely rough approximations, as the course taken by Vasco da Gama
and the incidents of this memorable passage are not known to us.
We may mention that modern sailing vessels going from S. Thiago by
way of Sierra Leone and Ascension to the Cape, a distance of 5,410
miles, occupy on an average 49½ days on the passage, making thus
110 miles daily (58 in crossing from Sierra Leone to Ascension). A
ship going direct (3,770 miles) has performed the passage in 41 days,
thus averaging 92 daily. (See Admiral Fitzroy’s “Passage Tables” in
the <i>Meteorological Papers</i> published by the Admiralty in 1858.)</p></div>

dived, and would have capsized the boat had not the water been
shallow. In the afternoon, when Coelho and his people were returning
to the vessels, Velloso was observed to run down a hill. Vasco
da Gama, ever observant, saw this from his ship, and at once ordered
Coelho back, entering himself a boat to join him. Some delay or

real authority for these statements. The usual statement that this
pillar was erected on the Ilha da Cruz must henceforth be rejected,
as had already been done in 1575, when M. de Mesquita Perestrello
made a survey of this coast (see his Report in Pimental’s <i>Roteiro da

</p>
<p>
The distances given by the author are remarkably correct. From
the Cape of Good Hope to Mossel Bay (São Braz) is 60 leagues, as
stated by him. Thence to Santa Cruz is 56 leagues; from Santa
Cruz to the Rio de Infante is 21 leagues.
</p>
<p>
<i>Santa Cruz</i> is the largest of a group of islands in the western part of
Algoa Bay. It is 4 cables in length, rises to a height of 195 ft., and
is nearly all bare rock. <i>There are no springs.</i> The <i>Ilhéos chãos</i> are
readily identified with a cluster of low rocky islets about 7 leagues to
the east. The Cape Padrone of the charts marks the site of the last
pillar erected by Dias, and 5 leagues beyond it rises “Ship Rock,”
in the locality where Perestrello claims to have discovered the <i>Penedo
das Fontes</i> of Barros and other writers. Perestrello had, no doubt, in
his possession original documents (now lost) which enabled him to
identify the localities named by the early explorers. His substantial
agreement with the author of this <i>Roteiro</i> is most satisfactory.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_70" id="Footnote_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> Barros (<i>Dec. I</i>, l. 4, c. 4) tells us that Vasco da Gama entered
the Rio dos Reis, by others called Rio do Cobre, on Twelfth Night
(January 6). Goes, on the other hand, confirms the author of the
<i>Roteiro</i>, and there cannot be a doubt that Barros is mistaken. The
Rio dos Reis is, indeed, one of the rivers which enters the bay subsequently
called after Lourenço Marques, but discovered, either in 1501
by Sancho de Toar, one of the captains of Cabral’s fleet, or in the
following year by Antonio de Campo.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Hamy’s Chart has “R. do reys”, Canerio’s “G. de lom raios”
(evidently a corrupt rendering of “Golfo dos or delos Reis”, which
thus seems to have been the earliest name bestowed upon what is
now known as Delagoa Bay). The “agoada de bon passa” of Dr.
Hamy’s Chart, and the “Rio d’aguada” of Canerio, between this bay
and Cabo das Correntes, is clearly the locality referred to by the
author. Ribero (1529) has a “Rio de la laguna,” a “<i>rio de los reyes</i>”,
and further east, an “aguada de buena paz”. M. de Mesquita Perestrello
(1575) places the “Aguada da boa Paz” 15 leagues to the east
of “Rio do Ouro” (the Limpopo), and 43 leagues to the west of Cabo
das Correntes. This position corresponds to that of the Zavora
River of Admiralty Chart No. 648, in 34° 25´ E. It was here that
Vasco da Gama cast anchor. The reference to the “swell of the sea”
quite precludes the notion that he entered the well-sheltered Delagoa
Bay.
</p>
<p>
M. Kopke (in a note, <i>Roteiro</i>, p. 147) would place the “Aguada da
Boa Gente” between the Lagoa River and the Limpopo (Inhambane),
in 32° 23´ E., and says that this locality is still generally known as
“Aguada da Boa Paz”, but I can find no confirmation of this. Moreover,
if this be the “Aguada”, where, on this barren coast, are we to
look for the “Rio do Cobre”? (Compare Stanley’s <i>Vasco da Gama</i>,
p. 66). See Map III.</p></div>

the river of Mercy (see Stanley’s <i>Vasco da Gama</i>, p. 11).

Vasco da Gama had no doubt received special instructions to inquire
for that Christian potentate. At one time he was looked for inland
from Benin, but the information received from Pero de Covilhão, whom
King John had despatched overland to India, in 1487, no less than that
furnished by Lucas Marcos, an Abyssinian priest, who came to
Lisbon soon after Covilhão’s departure, confirmed the Portuguese in
the belief that the “Prester John” they were in quest of was the

to the “Mohit” of Admiral Sidi Ali ben Hosein (1554),
published by Dr. Bittner and Dr. Tomascheck (Vienna, 1897), the pilots
of the Indian Ocean determined relative latitudes by observing the
altitudes of certain stars. The result was expressed, not in degrees as
was done by the scientific astronomers of the day, but in <i>isbas</i> or
“fingers”, each equivalent to 1° 42´ 50´´. The instrument which they
used consisted of three staffs. Two of these were moveable on a
hinge, and were directed respectively upon the horizon, and the star
the altitude of which it was desired to determine. A third staff (or an
octant) was fixed at the end of the horizon-staff, and upon it the angle
observed could be read off. Vasco da Gama brought one of these
instruments with him to Portugal, but the astronomer of Cabral’s
expedition, who had been instructed to test its qualities, reported
unfavourably (<i>Alguns documentos</i>, 1892, p. 122). Yet the results
obtained by means of this instrument by the pilots of the Indian
Ocean were very satisfactory, and the charts prepared by these very
practical men were far more correct than the abortions produced by
“scientific” Arab geographers. Parallels (at intervals of one-eighth
of an <i>isba</i>) and meridians were marked upon these charts, and they
were superior in this respect to the Portulani of the Mediterranean
pilots. The meridians were probably drawn at intervals of <i>zams</i>,
which were equal to one-eighth <i>isba</i>, or three hours’ sail, or nearly
thirteen of our sea-miles. It is quite possible, as suggested by Dr.
Bittner, that these pilots also invented the cross-staff, for <i>balhestilho</i>,
the name by which this instrument became known in Portugal, is more
likely to be derived from the Arabic <i>al-balista</i> (altitude), than from the
Latin <i>ballista</i>. Compare also Barros (<i>Dec. I</i>, liv. 4, c. 6), where an
allusion is made to the instrument employed by the pilot who joined
Vasco da Gama at Malindi. Barros says that the instrument consisted
of three <i>taboas</i> or plates.</p></div>

which “the long roll of the Indian Ocean renders a place of trembling

Sir John Kirk writes to me: “The baixas de S. Raphael are
undoubtedly the coral reefs of Mtangata; and the Usambara mountains,
with their valleys, steep precipices, and lofty summits would,
especially at that season of the year, be plainly seen from the ships.
There can be no doubt as to this point, as these are the only mountains
that approach the coast and form so marked an object from the sea
when the air is clear. They are then visible from the town of
Zanzibar.”</p></div>

author was in reality the king’s son, who acted as regent. He may be
supposed to be the Sheikh Wagerage (Wajeraj), who in 1515 wrote a
letter to D. Manuel, in which he begged for permission to send
annually <i>one</i> vessel to Goa and to Mozambique. He very humbly (or
sarcastically?) addresses the king as the “fountain of the commerce
of all cities and kingdoms, the most equitable of sovereigns, and the
enricher of all people”; when, indeed, the Portuguese had crippled
the trade of Malindi, which had received them with open arms.
Another letter addressed to King Manuel was written by “Ali, King
of Melinde”, in 1520. Was this “king” the son of Wajeraj, or of the
“prince who visited Vasco da Gama on board his vessel”? F. João
de’ Sousa, who publishes these letters (<i>Documentos Arabicos</i>, Lisbon,
1790, pp. 67, 123), with a few comments, only obscures the point,
unless indeed Wajeraj the Sheikh and Ali the Prince be one and
the same person.

”White Goddess”, whilst Charton (III, p. 246) suggests Maha Maja
and her son Shakya. Our illustration is taken from E. Moor, <i>The
Hindu Pantheon</i>, new edition by Rev. W. O. Simpson (Madras, 1864)
Plate xxxv. It represents Krishna and his mother Devaki. When
Kansa (Devaki’s brother) heard of his birth, he ordered all newly-born
infants to be slain. The trays with animals and fruit are supposed to
symbolise Krishna’s power over the animal and vegetable kingdoms.

The Rev. J. Jacob Jaus, of the Basel Mission at Calicut, informs me

the goddess of small-pox, and highly venerated. Amma, in Malayalam,
means mother.</p></div>

down by the side of Vasco da Gama, he said: “If these be devils, I
worship the true God”; at which his chief smiled. But however this
may be, it is equally true that the reports furnished by the heads of the
expedition described these Hindus as Christians, and that the king
believed them to be so (see Appendix A).</p></div>

Nor is Gama made to say in the “Roteiro” that he had been sent
with a fleet of fifty ships, and that the voyage took two years (Stanley’s

the charge of forgery. As to truthfulness, that seems not to have

the town (to the left of it as seen from the sea) and at the extremity
of a narrow rocky promontory of only a few feet in height, is certainly
not the padrão erected by the great navigator, though it probably
occupies its site. When Cabral arrived at Malindi in 1501 the pillar
had been removed, it having proved a “stone of offence” to the people
of Mombaça. The king, however, had stowed it away carefully, and
had even caused the royal arms to be repainted. João de Sá, who had
been with Gama, identified it.
</p>
<p>
The existing pillar, of which we give an illustration, is built up of
concrete made of coral rock and lime. It rises to a height of 16 feet,
and is surmounted by a cross, bearing on the sea side the arms of
Portugal, but no inscription. It is not the pillar put up at the request
of Vasco da Gama, but Sir John Kirk feels sure that the cross is very
ancient. The latter is of sandstone, and evidently of local make,
whilst the other crosses discovered hitherto are of limestone or
marble. See Introduction.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_240" id="Footnote_240"></a><a href="#FNanchor_240"><span class="label">[240]</span></a> I have little doubt that instead of Baqua we ought to read Bezoar.
In D. Manuel’s letter to the King of Castile, the royal writer states
that among the presents which the King of Cochin gave to Vasco da
Gama (in 1502) there was a stone as large as a filbert, which was
taken out of the head of a very rare animal, called Burgoldof, and
which proved a specific against all poisons.
</p>
<p>
The Rev. J. J. Jaus, of the Basel Mission, informs me that the
bezoar, in Malayalam, is called <i>Gōrōchanam</i>, which means “out of
the cow’s brain”, <i>go</i> signifying cow. It still sells for its weight in
silver, and is highly prized as a medicine and antidote. My esteemed
correspondent is unable to enlighten me as to the meaning of
<i>burgoldof</i>.
</p>
<p>
Bishop J. M. Speechly, in a letter addressed to me, suggests that
“Baqua” (Bakwa) may be a corruption of “Bagawat”, a common
name for Shiva, and the “Stone of Baqua” a dedication to him.
</p>
<p>
The Arabic name of the bezoar (badesar) has the meaning of
antidote. This “stone” is a calcareous concretion found in the
intestines of some animals, more especially goats and antelopes, but
also in those of monkeys. It varies in size from a pea to a fist. All
through the Middle Ages, this oriental bezoar was looked upon as a
most potent medicine against poisons, and it is still highly valued in
the East. The Bezoar of Goa (Gowa) is an artificial product made up
of musk, ambergris, and gum of tragacanth.</p></div>

musk, £15 11<i>s.</i>; aloe-wood, 24<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>; frankincense, 0.9<i>d.</i> to 1.5<i>d.</i>
A purchaser of one pound of each of these commodities would have
paid at Calecut £17 13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and would have received at Alexandria
£57 12<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, an increase of 210 per cent. (See Lord Stanley of

<p><a name="Footnote_340" id="Footnote_340"></a><a href="#FNanchor_340"><span class="label">[340]</span></a> This information was apparently never asked for. The “strangers”
were undoubtedly Chinese. Marco Polo (<i>Yule</i>, I, p. lxvi, and II,
pp. 197, 327) already mentions their four-masted vessels. In his time,
Chinese vessels regularly visited the west coast of India. The vizor
in the guise of a mask, distinctly points to the Chinese, and the
sword attached to a spear is a Chinese weapon. Up to the introduction
of pig-tails by the Manju, in 1644, the Chinese wore their hair
long. A punitive fleet of sixty-two Chinese vessels was sent to Ceylon
in 1401. In 1417 an embassy was sent from Mu-ku-tu-su (Magadoxo)
to China (Bretschneider, <i>On the Knowledge possessed by the Ancient
Chinese of the Arabs</i>, London, 1871), and in 1431 Chinese junks might
be seen at Jedda (Hirth, <i>Verhandlungen</i>, Berlin Geographical Society,
1889, p. 46).

During the second half of the fifteenth century the intercourse
between China and Malabar seems to have become rare, until at last
it ceased altogether (Richthofen, <i>China</i>, I, p. 10, 5).

seems to have misunderstood the writer. The statement that provisions
were sent from Melinde to Calecut can hardly be accepted,
and it was perhaps for this reason that Ramusio suppressed the name
of that town. The country around Calecut is certainly sandy, but it
is not as sterile as the bald statement of the writer would lead one to
believe, for the city lies in the midst of extensive groves of palm,
mango, and jack trees.

Calecut when Vasco da Gama first visited that town, nor are there
many now. Cochin, and not Calecut, was the chief seat of the
Syrian Christians of Malabar. They were an offshoot of the church
of Persia, which recognised the Nestorian patriarch of Babylon
(Mosul). After the condemnation of their dogmas by the Council of
Ephesus (431) they sought a refuge in distant countries. After 1599
many of them recognised the Pope, but after the ascendency of the
Dutch (since 1653) some turned Protestants, whilst others recognised
the Jacobite bishop of Antioch as their head. Popularly they are
known as S. Thomas Christians, although there exists not the slightest
evidence of that Apostle ever having visited India. Their worship is
of a simple nature: they admit no images to their churches, reject the
doctrine of transubstantiation, and allow their priests to marry
(G. Milne Rae, <i>The Syrian Church in India</i>, 1892; Percy Badger,
<i>The Nestorians and their Ritual</i>, 1852; German, <i>Die Kirche der

<p><a name="Footnote_415" id="Footnote_415"></a><a href="#FNanchor_415"><span class="label">[415]</span></a> Abraham ben Samuel Zacuto was professor of astronomy and
mathematics in the University of Salamanca when King John II
called him to Portugal in 1492, and appointed him Astronomer Royal.
He is the author of <i>Ephemerides</i>, originally written in Hebrew, a
Latin translation of which, by José Vizinho, one of his pupils, was first
printed in 1496&mdash;on the eve of Vasco da Gama’s departure&mdash;although
there can be no doubt that these useful tables previously circulated in
MS. José Vizinho is perhaps identical with the physician José whom
King John had charged, jointly with Master Rodrigo, to prepare
tables of the declination of the sun, which would enable navigators to
determine their latitude after they had lost sight of the Pole star.
Rudolf Wolf (<i>Geschichte der Astronomie</i>, p. 97) credits Regiomontanus
with having produced the first set of “practical” tables for the use of
mariners. He does not even once mention Zacuto in his history, and
states that the tables of the great German astronomer were those
made use of by Dias and Vasco da Gama. As the <i>Ephemerides</i> of
Regiomontanus were printed in 1474, they naturally became more
widely known than those of Zacuto, which only circulated in MS., and
they were, perhaps, brought to Portugal by Martin Behaim. It cannot,
however, be doubted that the tables which Vasco da Gama took
with him were those of Zacuto.

was a device bestowed upon D. Manuel by King João II. A coin
called an “Esphera de Ouro” was coined in Portuguese India. M.B.
Lopez Fernandes (<i>Memoria das moedas</i>, Lisbon, 1856, p. 121) had
such a coin in his possession. It had the device on the face, and a
royal crown with the word <span class="smcap">MEA</span> on the obverse. Manuel de Faria
(<i>Noticias de Portugal</i>, Disc. <span class="smcap">IV</span>, § 31) thinks that <span class="smcap">MEA</span> stands for
“Mine”, meaning that the whole sphere was Manuel’s; but Fernandes
is inclined to think that it stands for <span class="smcap">MEIA</span>, that is, “Half”. The
coin in his collection had an intrinsic value of about six shillings.

King’s presence, but the description of the paintings which were to

after due consideration we now give the preference to the track laid
down upon our chart. On an old map of Africa, by H. Moll, a “tract”

“a good course of sailing from Great Britain to the East Indies in
the Spring and Fall”. What would Admiral Wharton say to this?</p></div>

Juan de la Cosa, as is supposed by the Editor of Spruner’s <i>Historical
Atlas</i>, for the chart of the Spanish pilot which contains this name
was completed before Cabral’s return. If we can credit a statement
of Correa (Stanley’s <i>Vasco da Gama</i>, p. 825), who quotes Gaspar da
Gama as his authority, Cabral also discovered Tristão da Cunha.
He certainly must have been very near these islands when several of

Castile (“Centenario do descobrimento da America”, Lisbon, 1892),
says that João da Nova sailed to the Terra de Santa Cruz (Brazil),
and thence to the Cape. He does not mention Ascension (Conceiçao).
This, however, is not conclusive, for Kings, unlike Popes, are not
infallible. Barros, Goes, and Galvão are our authorities for the discovery
of the island of Concepçao in 8° S.</p></div>

enable us to trace the physical features of the coast, but their nomenclature
is not always that of the original discoverers. Nor are we so
fortunate as to possess such full descriptions of the coast as are to
be found in the “Africa Pilot”, for the <i>Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis</i> (1505)
of the famous Duarte Pacheco Pereira stops short at the Rio de
Infante; whilst works such as Linschoten’s <i>Itinerarium ofte Schipvaert</i>,
belong either to a much later epoch, or are of too general a
nature to prove of use when attempting to identify the more obscure
place-names. I think it was Admiral Ignacio da Costa Quintella, the
author of the <i>Annaes da marinha Portugueza</i>, who regretted that the
task of writing the history of Portuguese exploration should have
devolved almost exclusively upon landsmen, who neglected to give
satisfactory accounts of the routes followed by the early navigators.

<b>Cruzado</b>, a Portuguese gold coin, weighing 71.25 grãos
(4,608 grãos = 1 marc = 229.5 grammes) of fine gold, and consequently
worth 9<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> It retained this value up to 1555, when, being coined of
gold having a fineness of 22⅝ carat only, its value was reduced to 9<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i><br /><br />

Up to 1499, 380 réis were accepted as the equivalent of a cruzado; between 1499 and 1517
the rate of exchange was 390 réis, and after that date 400 réis. This shows that the
relative value of gold to silver was assumed to have been as
1:10 (in England about the same time the rate of exchange was as 1:11).<br /><br />

The value of 100 réis was consequently 30.5<i>d.</i> up to 1499, 29.82<i>d.</i> from
1499 to 1517, and 29.08<i>d.</i> after 1517 (see Nunes, <i>O livro dos Pesos, 1555</i>,
published at Lisbon in 1868; and M. B. Lopes Fernandes, <i>Memoria das moedas correntes
em Portugal</i>, Lisbon, 1856).<br /><br /></li><li>

<b>League.</b> The Portuguese (Castilian) legoa of 7,500 varas was
equal to 6,269 meters, or 20,568 feet, and 17.72 of these legoas
were consequently equal to one mean degree of a meridian. The Portuguese
pilots generally assumed 17½ of these legoas to be equal to 1°; and
had they known the real size of the earth the league would have been
6,350 m., an error of only 1.27 per cent. in the estimate of the size
of the earth as determined by observation for latitude taken at sea.<br /><br />

There can hardly be a doubt that the Italian mile was the same as the
old Roman mile, and had a length of 1,480 m. Consequently, 4.236
of these miles were equal to a legoa, and when Sernigi (see p. <a href="#Page_124">124</a>)
reckons 4¼ of these miles to a legoa he is very near the truth. On the
Cantino chart 75 Italian miles are = 1° = 17.5 Portuguese legoas, and
if we accept this estimate the legoa would be = 4.29 Italian miles. The
Portuguese pilots at the Conference of Badajoz (1525), maintained, however,
that 1 legoa = 4 Italian miles. As to Prof. Wagner’s “Portulano
mile” (<i>Report of Sixth International Geographical Congress</i>, p. 698) of
only 1,265 m., its shortness is obviously due to the very common
over-estimate of distances, even
<span class="pagenum padl1"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
when there is no mileage charge as
in the case of London cabmen.</li><li>
